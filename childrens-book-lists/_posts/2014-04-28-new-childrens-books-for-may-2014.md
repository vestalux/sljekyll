## Picture books

### [Baby beats by Karen Blair](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/32359560?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(33163574)&QRYTEXT=Baby%20beats)

5 children and a cat make music together with rattles, shakers and drums in this sweet little rhyming picture book. Set to become a classic.

### [Some bugs by Angela DiTerlizzi](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/32360240?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(33733886)&QRYTEXT=Some%20bugs)

Brendan Wenzel’s wonderfully cheerful insect illustrations, elevate this picture book from a super rhyming book to read aloud, into a really useful book about garden wildlife. Brilliant stuff!

### [Abigail by Catherine Rayner](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/32361963?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(584870)&QRYTEXT=Abigail)

Illustrated in her usual soft colour palette, Catherine Rayner has produced another beautiful picture book in which Abigail the giraffe, teaches zebra, ladybird and cheetah to count. The story isn’t Rayner’s best but her illustrations are superb.

## Beginner reads/short chapter books

### [

No boys allowed by Poppy Harper](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/32362763?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(38864250)&QRYTEXT=No%20boys%20allowed!)

Amidst the chaos of family life, lives a likeable heroine Maisie-Mae. Forced to share a room with her twin brothers, she holds her own in the practical joke stakes. But then a new attic bedroom is up-for-grabs, and Maisie-Mae’s determined to win it.

Q: Likes pink, cushions and unicorns ? A: Yes. Q: Gives as good as she gets? A: Oh yes. Definitely.

</h3>

A “warm, gentle exploration of culture and family life” unfolds as Anna Hibiscus travels from their home in the city to the African village where her grandfather was born.

## Junior novels

### [The great escape by Natalie Haynes](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/32365255?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(170528)&QRYTEXT=The%20great%20escape)

If you missed it in 2007 when it was first published, make sure you catch up the paperback reissue of this fast paced novel for children. Haynes is as funny in print as she is on the radio, and with a geeky hero who helps to release cats from a lab, she appeals to boys and girls alike.

### Attack of the giant robot chickens by Alex McCall

_On order_.

Aberdeen is being terrorised by giant robotic chickens. A group of children hatch a plot to save the city and thwart the invaders. Will they succeed? Ignore the cover, just read the book and find out.

## Young Teen

### [Half my Facebook friends are ferrets by J A Buckle](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/32374604?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(33425705)&QRYTEXT=Half%20my%20Facebook%20friends%20are%20ferrets)

Josh, a teenager with a taste for heavy metal, an annoying sister and a much loved pet ferret called Ozzy, records his life in the run-up to his 16th birthday and GCSEs. Teen angst and literary humour combine to make this diarised novel very funny and a more substantial read than <cite>Tom Gates</cite>.

I wonder if Josh will ever write his essay on <cite>Ferrets; their role in modern society</cite>, or release the album <cite>Slowly dying inside</cite> by Joshua Walker’? I hope so. But if he doesn’t, then I hope he records his A level years with the same wit.

### [One Crow Alone by S D Crockett](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/32379510?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(17402336)&QRYTEXT=One%20crow%20alone)

Just out in paperback, this gripping dystopian novel is a prequel to <cite>After the Snow</cite> which was set in a frozen Cornwall. In <cite>One Crow</cite>, Magda finds herself alone in her Ukrainian village after the neighbours are evacuated to the city.

We follow Magda to the city where she teams up with street-wise Ivan, and their subsequent journey to London in the back of container. Another brilliant read from S D Crockett, which deserves a wider audience.

## Older Teen

### [The 100 by Kass Morgan](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/32380816?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(24792312)&QRYTEXT=The%20100)

There are many dark twists to the plot in this stunning debut novel. The characters are faced with moral and political choices throughout this dystopian thriller, in which 100 young offenders are sent back to repopulate a post-apocalyptic earth. Powerful stuff from another talented young writer.

  Me and Earl and the Dying Girl by Jesse Andrews
</h3>

_On order_.

Greg, 17, pupil at Benson High, Pittsburgh, is an expert in self-denigration. The blurb on the back cover says “Compulsively readable, inevitably bawdy, and very funny.” We agree.
