## [<cite>Singles</cite> by Future Islands](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/19964924?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(16112012)&QRYTEXT=Singles%20%5Bsound%20recording%5D)

If you haven’t had a chance to catch their performance on US television’s Late Show with David Letterman last month take a look. In an era of bland music on talk shows this was an extraordinary spectacle. Singer Sam Herring sings every note as though his life depends on it. Even Letterman – for whom most musical performances pass like commercials – exclaimed: “I’ll take all of what you got!”

## [<cite>Caustic love</cite> by Paolo Nutini](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/19966330?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(27343869)&QRYTEXT=Caustic%20love%20%5Bsound%20recording%5D)

You never know quite what to expect from Paolo Nutini and this new album is no exception. He exploded onto the scene in 2006 with his pop flavoured <cite>These Streets</cite> selling 1.5 million in the UK. Three years later he moved on again, with the acclaimed <cite>Sunny Side Up</cite>.

Brit nominated, Ivor Novello winner, he was the biggest selling UK male artist of 2009 and 2010. This new album showcases his maverick talent and incredible vocal prowess with a maturity way beyond his 27 years.

## [<cite>The Cautionary Tales Of Mark Oliver Everett</cite> by Eels](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/19967275?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(37214562)&QRYTEXT=Perform%20the%20cautionary%20tales%20of%20Mark%20Oliver%20Everett%20%5Bsound%20recording%5D)

Described by Eels frontman ‘E’ Mark Everett as “an extraordinarily vivid and intimate document of a personal struggle. It’s inspired by something I went through.

“Someone I lost, by choice, and later came to regret losing. It wasn’t until I started to look at my role in it that it began to feel like I was getting somewhere worthwhile. The experience transformed me. This is the musical version of that experience. I’m hoping it could maybe serve as some sort of example for others. To learn from my mistakes.”

## [<cite>Silver rails</cite> by Jack Bruce](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/19976275?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(36217368)&QRYTEXT=Silver%20rails%20%5Bsound%20recording%5D)
