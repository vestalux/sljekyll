## [<cite>X</cite> by Ed Sheeran](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/7208441?QRY=CAUBIB%3C%20IRN(13613979)&QRYTEXT=Sheeran%2C%20Ed%2C%201991-)

Ed said recently in an interview that his new album would appear on February 17. We know that he has been working with Pharrell Williams and Rick Rubin, so that and his recent contribution to _The Hobbit_ movie suggest it will be one of the musical highlights of 2014.

## [<cite>Little red</cite> by Katy B](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/7208908?QRY=CAUBIB%3C%20IRN(9656503)&QRYTEXT=B%2C%20Katy)

In 2011 Katy exploded onto the UK music scene when her debut album _On A Mission_ produced 3 Top 10 singles and was nominated for several awards including the Mercury Prize.

Since then Katy has been growing and evolving musically. The arrival of the _Danger_ EP in late 2012 set the tone for what might come, whetting appetites and building anticipation and excitement for her second album.

Katy has spent that time holed up in the studio in London, honing a plethora of tracks and ideas into a finely tuned follow-up to _On A Mission_’. She and her producer Geeneus have promised a stunning collection of tracks, all of them undeniable Katy B tunes which come wrapped in pop perfection and polish displaying her incredible vocal.

## [<cite>Drowners</cite> by Drowners](http://suffolklibraries.freegalmusic.com/artists/view/RHJvd25lcnM=/888003385146/aW9kYQ==)

In the late summer of 2011, Drowners frontman Matthew Hitt found himself in New York City. He’s from a small town in rural Wales but New York is where Hitt feels most at home.

“I just like the way things look here. I like the way things are done here. I like how late everything happens,” he says. New York’s signature up-all-night energy courses through Drowners’ self–titled debut, but there’s a sweet melancholy to the album as well.

London-based electro-pop outfit Cymbals describe themselves as downtown disco, and say they want to “make music that makes people want to dance and feel joy.”
