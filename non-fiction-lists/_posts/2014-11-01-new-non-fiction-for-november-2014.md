      Linda Leaming, a harried American traveled from Nashville, Tennessee, to the rugged Himalayan nation of Bhutan &#8211; sometimes called the happiest place on Earth &#8211; to teach English and unlearn her politicised and polarised, energetic and impatient way of life. Forced by circumstance and her rustic surroundings to embrace a simplified life, Leaming made room for more useful beliefs. This collection of stories, impressions, and suggestions is a little nudge, a push, a leg up into the rarefied air of paradise &#8211; of bright sunlight and beautiful views.
