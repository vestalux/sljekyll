Suffolk’s Libraries Industrial and Provident Society Limited is our formally registered name. We call ourselves <strong>Suffolk Libraries</strong>.

We are an <a href="http://www.fca.org.uk/firms/firm-types/mutual-societies/industrial">Industrial and Provident Society</a>, a not for profit, independent and charitable organisation set up in August 2012 to run the service for the benefit of the people of Suffolk.

All libraries in Suffolk are run by Suffolk Libraries. We're contracted by <a href="http://www.suffolk.gov.uk/">Suffolk County Council</a> to run the service.

Our membership is drawn from <a title="Member organisations" href="http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/about/member-organisations/">member organisations</a>, community groups made up of people who want to support their library and have a say in how they are run. Each library in Suffolk works with local people to develop these member organisations.

Member organisations elect <a title="Board members" href="http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/about/board-members/">our board</a>.
