[![The Very Hungry Caterpillar’s Christmas 123 by Eric Carle](/images/article/the-very-hungry-caterpillars-christmas-123.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/12258619?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(44978468)&QRYTEXT=The%20very%20hungry%20caterpillar%27s%20Christmas%20123)

Don’t bother counting all those puddings and Christmas trees, just find the little caterpillars hidden in this lovely board book. When you’ve found them all, why not <a href="http://www.eric-carle.com/ColoringSheet.jpg">print out a colouring sheet</a> to while away 3 seconds of Boxing Day?

### [<cite>Eight Jolly Reindeer</cite> by Ilanit Oliver](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/12318476?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(41339899)&QRYTEXT=Eight%20jolly%20reindeer)

If you are one of those people who flatten out the silver foils after you’ve eaten a chocolate Christmas tree decoration, then this is the board book for you. The silvery tabs and the corny rhyming text are perfect additions to Christmas.

## Picture books for young children

### [<cite>The Empty Stocking</cite> by Richard Curtis & Rebecca Cobb](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/13078031?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(12981604)&QRYTEXT=The%20empty%20stocking)

[![The Empty Stocking by Richard Curtis & Rebecca Cobb](/images/article/the-empty-stocking.jpg)](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/13078031?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(12981604)&QRYTEXT=The%20empty%20stocking)

I bet you’ve never said “Father Christmas won’t bring you any presents if you behave like that”? Let those parents who have said it take heed. In this morality tale by THE Richard Curtis about a good twin and a bad twin, Father Christmas only goes and gives the presents to the WRONG TWIN! Rebecca Cobb’s illustrations are joyous.

### [<cite>Aliens love Panta Claus</cite> by Claire Freedman & Ben Cort](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/13103114?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(1235177)&QRYTEXT=Aliens%20love%20Panta%20Claus)

Such is the demand amongst the reading public of Suffolk, we’ve already had to buy more copies of this brilliant picture book. Need a taster? “The aliens are excited as tomorrow’s Christmas Day, so instead of stealing underpants, they’re giving them away”. How could we resist?
