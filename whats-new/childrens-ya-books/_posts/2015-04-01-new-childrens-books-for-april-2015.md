Start off with a dear little puppy in a warm comfy bed, add loads more animals one by one, finish off with a tiny little mouse and guess what happens. A beautifully predictable cumulative tale. Aaaah!

### [<cite>This is my rock</cite> by David Lucas](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/27221042?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(46868247)&QRYTEXT=This%20is%20my%20rock)

### [<cite>The bus is for us!</cite> by Michael Rosen and Gillian Tyler](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/27226976?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(38038628)&QRYTEXT=The%20bus%20is%20for%20us!)

A celebration of journeys from one of our national treasures. Gillian Tyler’s gentle illustrations remind me of Allan Ahlberg and are a perfect accompaniment to the Rosen text. Beautifully produced, with a pleasingly bold font and dreamy watercolours.

First published around 10 years ago, the <cite>Titchy Witch</cite> series have been given a well-deserved make over. The Witch household, featuring Titchy and her mother Witchy, is more or less run by the suave (and practical) Cat-a-bogus, but Titchy Witchy is always there in the thick of it.

Fourth title in the <cite>Pets from Space</cite> series for newly independent readers, launched last summer with <cite>Splash landing</cite>. Funny, fast moving, packed with illustrations and just a tad silly – all good stuff for kids who&#8217;ve just mastered the art of reading by themselves.

Highly recommended gem of a book encompassing environmental issues, peer pressure, family dynamics and politics with a goodly dash of theatre.

## Younger teen

### [<cite>Game changer</cite> by Tim Bowler](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/27255291?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(47112938)&QRYTEXT=Game%20changer)

Fast paced, thrilling read that you won’t be able to put down. The main protagonist is agoraphobic and the gang of teenagers who seek him are vicious and determined. It’s as good as Bowler&#8217;s <cite>Night Runner</cite> from last year.
