## Picture books

### [<cite>The Princess and the Giant</cite> by Caryl Hart & Sarah Warburton](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/2227399?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(46868208)&QRYTEXT=The%20princess%20and%20the%20giant)

[![The princess and the giant by Caryl Hart & Sarah Warburton](/images/article/the-princess-and-the-giant.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/2227399?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(46868208)&QRYTEXT=The%20princess%20and%20the%20giant)

The story is funny, the text rhymes and the illustrations are gorgeous and packed full of interesting little details. Add a brave, thoughtful and kind young heroine with a passion for books and you’ve got the perfect book for story time.

### [<cite>I need a wee!</cite> by Sue Hendra & Paul Linnet](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/2233094?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(46651361)&QRYTEXT=I%20need%20a%20wee!)

[![I need a wee! by Sue Hendra & Paul Linnet](/images/article/i-need-a-wee.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/2233094?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(46651361)&QRYTEXT=I%20need%20a%20wee!)

I tried to share this with two little boys, but was deafened by their laughter. If the children you share books with are always polite and never joke about toilets, you may have more luck.

### [<cite>Lily and Bear</cite> by Lisa Stubbs](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/7249507?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(48511855)&QRYTEXT=Lily%20and%20Bear)

[![Lily and Bear by Lisa Stubbs](/images/article/lily-and-bear.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/7249507?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(48511855)&QRYTEXT=Lily%20and%20Bear)

Wonderful. Charming. Original.

### [<cite>You can’t take an elephant on the bus</cite> by Patricia Cleveland-Peck & David Tazzyman](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/3152216?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(47619458)&QRYTEXT=You%20can%27t%20take%20an%20elephant%20on%20the%20bus)

[![You can’t take an elephant on the bus by Patricia Cleveland-Peck & David Tazzyman](/images/article/you-cant-take-an-elephant-on-the-bus.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/7249507?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(48511855)&QRYTEXT=Lily%20and%20Bear)

“It would simply cause a terrible fuss!” This beautifully illustrated book is a riotous rhyming romp, perfect to read aloud or to pore over. Set to become a classic, it would be great for playgroup topics about transport or animals, as well as a joy in itself. David Tazzyman illustrates the <cite>Mr Gum</cite> books too, so is a master of the joyously daft.

### [<cite>Hippobottymus</cite> by Steve Smallman & Ada Grey](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/3150727?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(47355779)&QRYTEXT=Hippobottymus)

[![Hippobottymus by Steve Smallman & Ada Grey](/images/article/hippobottymus.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/3150727?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(47355779)&QRYTEXT=Hippobottymus)

A repetitive musical rhyme involving a mouse, a bird, a warthog and more. It gets your feet tapping and would be fun to read with a group (as long as you don’t mind rude bits).

### [<cite>The First Slodge</cite> by Jeanne Willis & Jenni Desmond](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/3150056?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(51022031)&QRYTEXT=The%20first%20Slodge)

[![The First Slodge by Jeanne Willis & Jenni Desmond](/images/article/the-first-slodge.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/3150056?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(51022031)&QRYTEXT=The%20first%20Slodge)

Jenni Desmond’s simple illustrations bring warmth to this uplifting modern fable about sharing the earth.

Strong narrative and detailed illustrations make it a good choice for 7 – 9 year olds.

Joe Perkin’s discovery that the local park is to be built over coincides with the Prime Minister’s visit to his school.

This first title in the new <cite>Feral</cite> series, <cite>The crow talker</cite> is getting great reviews. But not by me &#8211; I’m too wuss to read it. The cover is brilliant though.

If you read <cite>Dandelion Clocks</cite> last year, you’ll know you’re in for a poignant read, so get your hankies ready. It’s a beautifully written book, mostly set in the gardens of a care-home, featuring a growing friendship between a teenage girl and a very old lady.
