### [<cite>The third wheel</cite> by Jeff Kinney](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/4194193?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(161030)&QRYTEXT=Diary%20of%20a%20Wimpy%20Kid%3A%20The%20Third%20wheel)

The 7th volume of Jeff Kinney’s _Wimpy Kid_ series, out in paperback in time for Valentine’s Day. Greg Heffley’s school burns down after the Valentine Dance.

January and February have seen the debut of 3 new humorous series for children, all of which look set to become must reads for 7–10 yr olds:

### [<cite>Supercat</cite> by Jean Willis](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/4204589?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(36545454)&QRYTEXT=Supercat%20vs%20the%20chip%20thief)

Kicks off with _Supercat vs the chip thief_ about a tabby cat who looks more like a treacle pudding in tights than the superhero he wants to be.

### [<cite>The Diary of Dennis the Menace</cite> by Steven Butler](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/4203924?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(36546769)&QRYTEXT=The%20diary%20of%20Dennis%20the%20Menace)
