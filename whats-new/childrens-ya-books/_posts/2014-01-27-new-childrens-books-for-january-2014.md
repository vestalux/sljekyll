## Picture books

### [<cite>That dog!</cite> by Gillian Shields](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/6518249?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(1391765)&QRYTEXT=That%20dog!)

The eponymous dog leaves his mean minded family to seek his fortune on the stage. Much more fun!

### [<cite>Scruffy Bear and the lost ball</cite> by Christopher Wormell](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/5800138?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(1168394)&QRYTEXT=Scruffy%20Bear%20and%20the%20lost%20ball)

Missing the John Lewis advert already and longing to see more rabbits and a bear? Then here’s the perfect picture book.

## Short chapter books

### [<cite>Queen Bee!</cite> by Alan McDonald](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/5800522?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(35039959)&QRYTEXT=Queen%20bee!)

Angela Nicely is a feisty new heroine from the author of the very popular <cite>Dirty Bertie</cite> series. Good news for little girls!

### [<cite>Choosing Crumble</cite> by Michael Rosen](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/5800840?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(32043877)&QRYTEXT=Choosing%20Crumble)

Actually it’s the dog, Crumble, who does the choosing and it was Tony Ross who drew him. Bound to be good for a laugh.

## Junior novels

### [<cite>Baby aliens got my teacher</cite> by Pamela Butchart](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/21608347?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(32041964)&QRYTEXT=Baby%20aliens%20got%20my%20teacher!)

Why is Miss Jones being nice all of a sudden? There’s only one explanation!

### [<cite>Knightley and son</cite> by Rohan Gavin](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/21609119?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(35743986)&QRYTEXT=Knightley%20%26%20Son)

A fast paced mystery adventure about a father/son detective team. I hope this is the start of a new series. Definitely one to look out for.

## Teen novels

### [<cite>Noble Conflict</cite> by Malorie Blackman](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/5801609?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(25297198)&QRYTEXT=Noble%20conflict)

Written by the current Children’s Laureate <cite>Noble Conflict</cite> is an edge of your seater, with ethics. Brilliant.

If you missed this when it came out in hardback in 2013, put your name down for the new paperback edition to carry you into January.
