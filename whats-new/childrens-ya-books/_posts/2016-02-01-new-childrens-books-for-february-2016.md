A rolling rhyming romp of a book, with very bright illustrations, this would be great to read at story times, and not bad for bedtime either.

Gorgeously produced on lovely thick paper with illustrations dabbed with humour (it’s published by Andersen Press who know a thing or two about making gorgeous books) this picture book is a must. It’s about a young rabbit, mighty suspicious of the baby (wolf) whose arrival is greeted by the rest of the family with coos and smiles and photos. Wonderful , wonderful, wonderful.

## Junior novels

### [<cite>Anyone but Ivy Pocket</cite> by Caleb Krisp](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/17678248?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(47619459)&QRYTEXT=Anyone%20but%20Ivy%20Pocket)

“When Albie&#8217;s mum dies, it&#8217;s natural he should wonder where she&#8217;s gone. His parents are both scientists and they usually have all the answers.

So Albie finds a box, his mum&#8217;s computer and a rotting banana, and sends himself through time and space to find her.”

Third in the Superhero School series, it bears the classic Alan MacDonald hallmark of silliness, we came to love in Dirty Bertie. In this episode, a weather forecaster is transformed into a malevolent robot. “With gadgets a-plenty, our young superheroes must battle through ice, snow, tornadoes and lightning strikes &#8211; but can they save the day?”

### [<cite>Danger down the Nile</cite> by James Patterson](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/17684949?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(39948596)&QRYTEXT=Danger%20down%20the%20Nile)

An adventure mystery starring girls as well as boys, is always welcome, and this one is a thrill-a-minute. This second title of the Treasure Hunters series sees the children of the Kidd family on a hair raising quest to rescue their parents from kidnappers. It’s “edge of the chair” stuff, illustrated with tons of kerpow!

This is the second title of Jeremy Strong’s new series “Romans on the rampage” about the young boy Perilus and his family. It’s full of interesting facts about daily life in Rome, and actual Latin words whilst being a hoot to read. Like “Carry on up the Colisseum”, but for children.

If you read their previous novel Lobsters a Rom Com set largely on a festival campsite, you’ll know to expect a good read. The main action in <cite>Never evers</cite> takes place at a French ski resort, and it’s so well written, you’ll laugh your way through it from the start in an English bathroom.

## YA

“Sophie and her family came to live in Belgium when she was only four or five years old, but she&#8217;s fourteen now and has never been quite sure why they left England in the first place. Then, one day” she finds her grandmother on Facebook, and hopes she can unlock the mystery of who she really is, why they are there and why her mother never goes out. It’s a brilliant read, once you get your head round the code that the author uses throughout, substituting one word for another eg kindle for kitchen, dormouse for door etc.
