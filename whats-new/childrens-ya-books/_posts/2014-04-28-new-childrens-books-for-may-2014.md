## Picture books

### [<cite>Baby beats</cite> by Karen Blair](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/32359560?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(33163574)&QRYTEXT=Baby%20beats)

5 children and a cat make music together with rattles, shakers and drums in this sweet little rhyming picture book. Set to become a classic.

### [<cite>Some bugs</cite> by Angela DiTerlizzi](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/32360240?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(33733886)&QRYTEXT=Some%20bugs)

Brendan Wenzel’s wonderfully cheerful insect illustrations, elevate this picture book from a super rhyming book to read aloud, into a really useful book about garden wildlife. Brilliant stuff!

Illustrated in her usual soft colour palette, Catherine Rayner has produced another beautiful picture book in which Abigail the giraffe, teaches zebra, ladybird and cheetah to count. The story isn’t Rayner’s best but her illustrations are superb.

## Beginner reads and short chapter books

### [<cite>No boys allowed</cite> by Poppy Harper](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/32362763?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(38864250)&QRYTEXT=No%20boys%20allowed!)

Amidst the chaos of family life, lives a likeable heroine Maisie-Mae. Forced to share a room with her twin brothers, she holds her own in the practical joke stakes. But then a new attic bedroom is up-for-grabs, and Maisie-Mae’s determined to win it.

Q: Likes pink, cushions and unicorns ? A: Yes. Q: Gives as good as she gets? A: Oh yes. Definitely.

## Junior novels

### [<cite>The great escape</cite> by Natalie Haynes](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/32365255?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(170528)&QRYTEXT=The%20great%20escape)

If you missed it in 2007 when it was first published, make sure you catch up the paperback reissue of this fast paced novel for children. Haynes is as funny in print as she is on the radio, and with a geeky hero who helps to release cats from a lab, she appeals to boys and girls alike.

## Young teen

### [<cite>Half my Facebook friends are ferrets</cite> by J A Buckle](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/32374604?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(33425705)&QRYTEXT=Half%20my%20Facebook%20friends%20are%20ferrets)

Josh, a teenager with a taste for heavy metal, an annoying sister and a much loved pet ferret called Ozzy, records his life in the run-up to his 16th birthday and GCSEs. Teen angst and literary humour combine to make this diarised novel very funny and a more substantial read than <cite>Tom Gates</cite>.

I wonder if Josh will ever write his essay on <cite>Ferrets; their role in modern society</cite>, or release the album <cite>Slowly dying inside</cite> by Joshua Walker’? I hope so. But if he doesn’t, then I hope he records his A level years with the same wit.

### [<cite>One Crow Alone</cite> by S D Crockett](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/32379510?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(17402336)&QRYTEXT=One%20crow%20alone)

Just out in paperback, this gripping dystopian novel is a prequel to <cite>After the Snow</cite> which was set in a frozen Cornwall. In <cite>One Crow</cite>, Magda finds herself alone in her Ukrainian village after the neighbours are evacuated to the city.

We follow Magda to the city where she teams up with street-wise Ivan, and their subsequent journey to London in the back of container. Another brilliant read from S D Crockett, which deserves a wider audience.

## Older teen

### [<cite>The 100</cite> by Kass Morgan](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/32380816?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(24792312)&QRYTEXT=The%20100)

There are many dark twists to the plot in this stunning debut novel. The characters are faced with moral and political choices throughout this dystopian thriller, in which 100 young offenders are sent back to repopulate a post-apocalyptic earth. Powerful stuff from another talented young writer.
