## Board books

### [<cite>Happy Christmas Spot!</cite> by Eric Hill](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/9418178?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(531369)&QRYTEXT=Happy%20Christmas%2C%20Spot!)

[![Happy Christmas Spot! by Eric Hill](/images/article/happy-christmas-spot.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/9418178?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(531369)&QRYTEXT=Happy%20Christmas%2C%20Spot!)

It’s super to see a new Spot book this Christmas. This one has nice sturdy flaps so even very young children can turn the pages. It’s a guessing game, or in National Curriculum parlance, &#8216;inference&#8217;!

### [<cite>Tickly Christmas Wibbly Pig!</cite> by Mick Inkpen](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/9423722?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(768385)&QRYTEXT=Tickly%20Christmas%2C%20Wibbly%20Pig!)

[![Tickly Christmas Wibbly Pig! by Mick Inkpen](/images/article/tickly-christmas-wibbly-pig.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/9423722?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(768385)&QRYTEXT=Tickly%20Christmas%2C%20Wibbly%20Pig!)

It&#8217;s Christmas, and Wibbly Pig&#8217;s Big Aunt Larlie has bought herself some balls of wool, more balls of wool than usual. Is there another tickly Christmas present on the way?

### [<cite>Mog&#8217;s Christmas</cite> by Judith Kerr](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/9424976?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(115421)&QRYTEXT=Mog%27s%20Christmas)

[![Mog's Christmas by Judith Kerr](/images/article/mogs-christmas.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/9424976?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(115421)&QRYTEXT=Mog%27s%20Christmas)

We just had to buy more of these! and of the below&#8230;

### [<cite>Mog’s Christmas calamity</cite> by Judith Kerr](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/16409948?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(58865849)&QRYTEXT=Mog%27s%20Christmas%20calamity)

[![Mog's Christmas calamity by Judith Kerr](/images/article/mogs-christmas-calamity.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/16409948?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(58865849)&QRYTEXT=Mog%27s%20Christmas%20calamity)

We love this book of the TV ad. It so perfectly represents Christmas – burnt turkey, tree falling over and all. How utterly joyous that Judith Kerr has had time to write and draw another Mog book, and that she made a cameo appearance in the advert! Long live Judith Kerr, our heroine.

### [<cite>Elmer&#8217;s Christmas</cite> by David McKee](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/9432167?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(52715682)&QRYTEXT=Elmer%27s%20Christmas)

[![Elmer's Christmas by David McKee](/images/article/elmers-christmas.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/9432167?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(52715682)&QRYTEXT=Elmer%27s%20Christmas)

It&#8217;s two days before the annual visit of Papa Red and the young elephants are very excited. They choose a tree to decorate and prepare the presents for Papa Red to collect during the night to take to those who need them. But this year Elmer has a special treat in store for the young elephants, if they can keep quiet and out of sight.

### [<cite>The best Christmas present ever!</cite> by Ben Mantle](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/9433875?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(53433811)&QRYTEXT=The%20best%20Christmas%20present%20ever!)

“It&#8217;s Christmas and Bear has forgotten to get his best friend Squirrel a present. Oh no! He&#8217;ll have to make something instead. Except Bear isn&#8217;t very good at making things. A badly knitted jumper, a terrible painting and a broken rocking chair are not the best Christmas presents ever &#8211; or are they?” A warm hearted Christmassy message.

### [<cite>How to catch Santa</cite> by Jean Reagan and Lee Wildish](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/12536078?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(53889510)&QRYTEXT=How%20to%20catch%20Santa)

[![How to catch Santa by Jean Reagan and Lee Wildish](/images/article/how-to-catch-santa.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/12536078?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(53889510)&QRYTEXT=How%20to%20catch%20Santa)

All the excitement of Christmas Eve is captured in this very funny new picture book, as a brother and sister plot how to catch Father Christmas.

### [<cite>Santa&#8217;s workshop</cite> by Jan Lewis](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/12551679?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(25772955)&QRYTEXT=Santa%27s%20workshop%20%3A%20the%20inside%20story!)

With several flaps to open on each page, this one should entertain for at least 3 minutes. Pity the reindeers have the wrong names (Fudge and Caramel), but I guess you can’t have everything.

### [<cite>The Tooth Fairy&#8217;s Christmas</cite> by Peter Bently and Garry Parsons](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/9820331?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(40990106)&QRYTEXT=The%20Tooth%20Fairy%27s%20Christmas)
