## Board books for babies and toddlers

### [<cite>Busy Bookshop</cite> by Marion Billot](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/13186880?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(37689775)&QRYTEXT=Busy%20bookshop)

[![Busy Bookshop by Marion Billot](/images/article/busy-bookshop.jpg)](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/13186880?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(37689775)&QRYTEXT=Busy%20bookshop)

Given the perplexing absence of &#8216;Busy library&#8217; from the <cite>Busy books</cite> series, this jolly little book will have to do. After all, it does celebrate stories and has a nice twiddly bit on each page, complicated enough to absorb rather than frustrate a child at the poking stage of development.

## Picture books for 2-5 year olds

### [<cite>The Book with No Pictures</cite> by B J Novak](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/13193973?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(47357484)&QRYTEXT=The%20Book%20with%20No%20Pictures)

[![The Book with No Pictures by B J Novak](/images/article/the-book-with-no-pictures.jpg)](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/13193973?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(47357484)&QRYTEXT=The%20Book%20with%20No%20Pictures)

No pictures, but loads of made-up words, a fan following and [its own website](http://thebookwithnopictures.com/). As a script writer, B. J. Novak is used to putting words into people’s mouths. See what he’s put into ours: “ GLuURR-GA-wocko ma GRUMPH-a-doo AiiEE! AiiEE! AiiEE! BRROOOOoOG BRROOOOoOG OOOOOOmph! EEEEEEmph! Blaggity-BLaGGITY GLIBBITY-globbity globbity-GLIBBITY BEEP. Boop. eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee eeeeee eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee B DooonGY FACE!!!!”! Synthetic phonics, or what?!

### [<cite>Princess Sleepyhead and the night-night bear</cite> by Peter Bently](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/16492095?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(40990492)&QRYTEXT=Princess%20Sleepyhead%20and%20the%20night-night%20bear)

[![Princess Sleepyhead and the night-night bear by Peter Bently](/images/article/princess-sleepyhead-and-the-night-night-bear.jpg)](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/16492095?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(40990492)&QRYTEXT=Princess%20Sleepyhead%20and%20the%20night-night%20bear)

If you’re exhausted after late Christmas bedtimes and long for normality, this lovely new story could set you on the way. There’s quite a lot of text, but it rhymes, it’s funny and it winds gently down to the end.

## Short chapter books for 6-8 year olds

### [<cite>The cupcake mystery</cite> by Linda Chapman](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/13391940?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(42385315)&QRYTEXT=The%20cupcake%20mystery)

[![The cupcake mystery by Linda Chapman](/images/article/the-cupcake-mystery.jpg)](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/13391940?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(42385315)&QRYTEXT=The%20cupcake%20mystery)

Take a dash of mystery and a dollop of friendship, mix well with cute illustrations and you have the recipe for this new title in the <cite>Hello Kitty and Friends</cite> series aimed at 7 to 9 year olds. There are about 14 other titles to read if this one takes your fancy.

## Junior novels for 8–12 year olds

### [<cite>The Pied Piper of Hamelin</cite> by Russell Brand](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/13188395?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(227928)&QRYTEXT=The%20Pied%20Piper%20of%20Hamelin)

[![The Pied Piper of Hamelin by Russell Brand](/images/article/the-pied-piper-of-hamelin.jpg)](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/13188395?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(227928)&QRYTEXT=The%20Pied%20Piper%20of%20Hamelin)

Russell Brand’s re-telling of this traditional tale will not be to everyone’s taste, (frequently including words like &#8220;gob&#8221; and &#8220;bum&#8221;), but Chris Riddell’s illustrations are sheer genius. His rats are a masterpiece of evil and his sinister Piper oozes menace.

### [<cite>Cowgirl</cite> by G R Gemin](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/13395697?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(9818111)&QRYTEXT=Cowgirl)

[![Cowgirl by G R Gemin](/images/article/cowgirl.jpg)](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/13395697?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(9818111)&QRYTEXT=Cowgirl)

Saving cows from an abattoir is an unlikely sub-plot, but this debut novel set on a Welsh housing estate is about much more. It deals with the loneliness of a girl whose father is in prison, an unlikely friendship she forms with girl from a nearby farm, and about a community who come together for a common cause. After just one chapter, I’m totally hooked.

### [<cite>We meet again</cite> by Steve Pastis](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/13397978?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(38544542)&QRYTEXT=We%20meet%20again)

[![We meet again by Steve Pastis](/images/article/we-meet-again.jpg)](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/13397978?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(38544542)&QRYTEXT=We%20meet%20again)

Read all the <cite>Wimpy Kids</cite> and <cite>Big Nates</cite>? Need another laugh? Timmy Failure, CEO of the aptly named detective agency, Failure Inc could fill your anti-hero gap. However, this is his third book, so you may prefer to read the first two books. Philip Ardagh, well-known author of <cite>The Grunts</cite> describes the <cite>Timmy Failure</cite> series as “original and quirky, with real heart” and we would never disagree with him &#8211; have you seen how tall he is?

## Older teen novels for 14+

### [<cite>Girl Online</cite> by Zoe Sugg](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/13209446?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(46866837)&QRYTEXT=Girl%20Online)

[![Girl Online by Zoe Sugg](/images/article/girl-online.jpg)](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/13209446?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(46866837)&QRYTEXT=Girl%20Online)

Zoe Sugg, vlogger with 3.5 million followers, debuts her first book. It’s about Penny, a panic struck, anxiety ridden teenager whose dad advises her to keep a diary. Penny decides to start a blog instead and this is the story of that blog. I was hooked before the end of the first page, but I can’t read it yet because so many other people in Suffolk want to read it too. Be quick, that’s all I can say! (And if unlike Penny, you fancy starting a diary instead of a blog, keep a lookout for our next book list, coming soon to a website near you!)
