## Board books

### [<cite>Baby’s first colours</cite> by Aimée Chapman and Penny Worms](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/25632475?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(55838954)&QRYTEXT=Baby%27s%20first%20colours)

[![Baby’s first colours by Aimée Chapman and Penny Worms](/images/article/babys-first-colours.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/25632475?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(55838954)&QRYTEXT=Baby%27s%20first%20colours)

Chunky, chew-resist, photographs and a mirror too &#8211; just the job for your bookish baby.

### [<cite>Goose needs a hug</cite> by Tad Hills](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/25635050?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(59643084)&QRYTEXT=Goose%20needs%20a%20hug)

[![Goose needs a hug by Tad Hills](/images/article/goose-needs-a-hug.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/25632475?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(55838954)&QRYTEXT=Baby%27s%20first%20colours)

A sweet little board book about friendship, from the very cute series <cite>Duck & Goose</cite>.

### [<cite>Little blue truck</cite> by Alice Schertle and Jill McElmurry](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/25637022?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(59642470)&QRYTEXT=Little%20blue%20truck)

[![Little blue truck by Alice Schertle and Jill McElmurry](/images/article/little-blue-truck.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/25637022?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(59642470)&QRYTEXT=Little%20blue%20truck)

This is a brilliant board book, fresh from the US best-seller charts. It’s a rhyming road-trip of a book, begging to be read in a square-dance-drawl. If only it were nearly Christmas I’d give it to every family of every toddler I know!

## Picture books

### [<cite>The elves and the shoemaker</cite> by Mara Alperin and Erica-Jane Waters](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/25645426?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(227815)&QRYTEXT=The%20elves%20and%20the%20shoemaker)

[![The elves and the shoemaker by Mara Alperin and Erica-Jane Waters](/images/article/the-elves-and-the-shoemaker-alperin.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/25645426?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(227815)&QRYTEXT=The%20elves%20and%20the%20shoemaker)

The shoes and boots made by the helpful elves in this re-telling are really something. Any shoemakers worth their leather would want to get their hands on them. Lovely book too!

### [<cite>We&#8217;re in the wrong book!</cite> by Richard Byrne](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/25653797?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(59641469)&QRYTEXT=We%27re%20in%20the%20wrong%20book!)

[![We're in the wrong book! by Richard Byrne](/images/article/were-in-the-wrong-book.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/25653797?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(59641469)&QRYTEXT=We%27re%20in%20the%20wrong%20book!)

That clever Richard Byrne has created another cunning treat of a picture book, to amuse and entertain young children through to the end of KS1. With lots of bookish text to talk about and an adventurous mixture of illustrative styles to enjoy, it’s perfect.

### [<cite>Beep beep beep time for sleep!</cite> by Claire Freedman and Richard Smythe](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/25659159?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(57600335)&QRYTEXT=Beep%20beep%20beep%20time%20for%20sleep!)

[![Beep beep beep time for sleep! by Claire Freedman and Richard Smythe](/images/article/beep-beep-beep-time-for-sleep.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/25659159?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(57600335)&QRYTEXT=Beep%20beep%20beep%20time%20for%20sleep!)

If your small child just loves diggers and trucks and concrete mixers and so on, this book will refresh the parts other lovely rhyming winding-down-at-the-end-of-the-day picture books just don’t reach.

### [<cite>Alan’s big scary teeth</cite> by Jarvis](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/25661150?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(57962058)&QRYTEXT=Alan%27s%20big%2C%20scary%20teeth)

[![Alan’s big scary teeth by Jarvis](/images/article/alans-big-scary-teeth.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/25661150?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(57962058)&QRYTEXT=Alan%27s%20big%2C%20scary%20teeth)

This hilarious picture book came out a couple of months ago, but then so did Alan’s big scary teeth! The pictures are great fun and as the dénouement is a storytelling session, it’s perfect to read aloud.

## Beginner reads

### [<cite>Meerkat&#8217;s marathon</cite> by Damian Harvey and Steve Brown](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/25683431?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(57599979)&QRYTEXT=Meerkat%27s%20marathon)

[![Meerkat's marathon by Damian Harvey and Steve Brown](/images/article/meerkats-marathon.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/25683431?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(57599979)&QRYTEXT=Meerkat%27s%20marathon)

This funny story about a clever meerkat is presented in a clear bold type to improve readability for very young readers. It’s from the new <cite>Froglets Animal Olympics</cite> series being published this year for obvious reasons. There are 5 other titles, including <cite>Hippo’s High Dive</cite> and <cite>The Jaguar and the javelin</cite>.

## Junior novels

### [<cite>Knitbone Pepper, ghost dog and the last circus tiger</cite> by Claire Baker and Ross Collins](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/25688870?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(62076893)&QRYTEXT=Knitbone%20Pepper%2C%20ghost%20dog%20and%20the%20last%20circus%20tiger)

[![Knitbone Pepper, ghost dog and the last circus tiger by Claire Baker and Ross Collins](/images/article/knitbone-pepper-ghost-dog-circus-tiger.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/25688870?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(62076893)&QRYTEXT=Knitbone%20Pepper%2C%20ghost%20dog%20and%20the%20last%20circus%20tiger)

You may have met Knitbone Pepper in 2015, when his first novel came out. If so, you’ll remember how he and Winnie helped her parents gets loads of money to save their beloved Starcross Hall. If you didn’t, I suggest you read that one first, before embarking on this second crazy adventure. If you did, read this next because there are even more ghosts, Knitbone P is as heroic as ever, the book is lovely to hold and the illustrations are perfect.

### [<cite>We are giants</cite> by Amber Lee Dodd](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/25691954?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(60139531)&QRYTEXT=We%20are%20giants)

[![We are giants by Amber Lee Dodd](/images/article/we-are-giants.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/25691954?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(60139531)&QRYTEXT=We%20are%20giants)

A moving story about a family forced to move from London to a new life in Portsmouth, <cite>We are giants</cite> is a small triumph. The author has incorporated many difficult issues, like grief, difference and bullying, into an absorbing, warm-hearted and rewarding read.

### [<cite>The shadow keeper</cite> by Abi Elphinstone](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/25695061?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(57600337)&QRYTEXT=The%20shadow%20keeper)

[![The shadow keeper by Abi Elphinstone](/images/article/the-shadow-keeper.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/25695061?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(57600337)&QRYTEXT=The%20shadow%20keeper)

This is the second book in an evocative series full of magic, mystery, and adventure. Moll, Gryff, Alfie, and Siddy are back as they continue their quest to battle the Shadowmasks and fulfil the Bone Murmur&#8217;s prophecy.

### [<cite>Warning cry</cite> by Kris Humphrie and Chellie Carroll](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/25698223?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(50742735)&QRYTEXT=Warning%20cry)

[![Warning cry by Kris Humphrie and Chellie Carroll](/images/article/warning-cry.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/25698223?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(50742735)&QRYTEXT=Warning%20cry)

The keenly awaited sequel to <cite>Guardians of the Wild</cite>, this is set in the same timeless world with magical animals, shape shifting, strong characters and adventure.

### [<cite>Nancy Parker&#8217;s diary of detection</cite> by Julia Lee and Chloe Bonfield](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/25707638?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(59641468)&QRYTEXT=Nancy%20Parker%27s%20diary%20of%20detection)

[![Nancy Parker's diary of detection by Julia Lee and Chloe Bonfield](/images/article/nancy-parkers-diary-of-detection.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/25707638?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(59641468)&QRYTEXT=Nancy%20Parker%27s%20diary%20of%20detection)

A mystery set on the south coast in the 1920s, in which 3 children foil a plan to steal people’s life savings. Jointly narrated by the children, Nancy a housemaid, who records her thoughts and events in her journal, Ella the solitary daughter of an American archaeologist and by Quentin, an unwilling scholar sent for extra tuition with a vicar, it’s delightfully old fashioned and a “jolly good read”.

### [<cite>There&#8217;s a dragon in my dinner!</cite> by Tom Nicoll and Sarah Horne](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/25712374?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(62076304)&QRYTEXT=There%27s%20a%20dragon%20in%20my%20dinner!)

[![There's a dragon in my dinner! by Tom Nicoll and Sarah Horne](/images/article/theres-a-dragon-in-my-dinner.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/25712374?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(62076304)&QRYTEXT=There%27s%20a%20dragon%20in%20my%20dinner!)

The miniature dragon from the title arrives unexpectedly in a box of bean sprouts from the Chinese take away, and that’s when life becomes chaotic. Packed with humorous illustrations by Sarah Horne, this fast-paced book is hilarious. It’s always exciting to find a funny new series of books for children in KS2 (we’ve ordered the next title <cite>Dragon in my backpack</cite> due out in May.) particularly one that appeals alike to both boys and girls.

### [<cite>The mystery of the jewelled moth</cite> by Katherine Woodfine](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/25714978?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(57961401)&QRYTEXT=The%20mystery%20of%20the%20jewelled%20moth)

[![The mystery of the jewelled moth by Katherine Woodfine](/images/article/the-mystery-of-the-jewelled-moth.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/25714978?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(57961401)&QRYTEXT=The%20mystery%20of%20the%20jewelled%20moth)

## Junior non-fiction

### [<cite>An illustrated treasury of Scottish mythical creatures</cite> by Theresa Breslin and Kate Leiper](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/25720643?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(48510982)&QRYTEXT=An%20illustrated%20treasury%20of%20Scottish%20mythical%20creatures)

[![An illustrated treasury of Scottish mythical creatures by Theresa Breslin and Kate Leiper](/images/article/an-illustrated-treasury-of-scottish-mythical-creatures.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/25720643?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(48510982)&QRYTEXT=An%20illustrated%20treasury%20of%20Scottish%20mythical%20creatures)

You might expect a tale from the Loch Ness Monster, but this stunningly beautiful book also has tales from The Orkney and The Shetland Islands, The Western Isles and more. The stories have a melodic feel to them and beg to be read aloud, whilst the illustrations are astounding in their beauty. It’s a fabulous book about fabulous beasts. What a pity it’s too early for Christmas!

### [<cite>On the space station</cite> by Carron Brown and Bee Johnson](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/25724625?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(49980857)&QRYTEXT=On%20the%20space%20station)

[![On the space station by Carron Brown](/images/article/on-the-space-station.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/25724625?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(49980857)&QRYTEXT=On%20the%20space%20station)

A nicely produced, clearly expressed book for children in Foundation and KS1, it contains hidden secrets which can only be revealed by holding it to the light. I won’t spoil the secrets, so you’ll have to borrow a copy to find out for yourself. (HINT: I found a torch worked even better!)

### [<cite>Inventions</cite> by DK pocket eyewitness](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/25726365?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(258421)&QRYTEXT=Inventions)

[![Inventions by DK pocket eyewitness](/images/article/inventions-dk-pocket-eyewitness.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/25726365?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(258421)&QRYTEXT=Inventions)

This Pocket Eyewitness guide from Dorling Kindersley is unputdownable. Full of photos, and snippets of facts, it’s just right for browsing &#8211; on train journeys, queuing at the doctor or a wet Sunday afternoon.

### [<cite>The sign of one</cite> by Eugene Lambert](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/25730319?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(60138168)&QRYTEXT=The%20sign%20of%20one)

[![The sign of one by Eugene Lambert](/images/article/the-sign-of-one.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/25730319?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(60138168)&QRYTEXT=The%20sign%20of%20one)

This gripping sci-fi thriller by a talented new author is set in a post-apocalyptic community led by &#8220;The Saviour&#8221;. In this divisive world, medieval in its cruelty, twins (&#8220;idents&#8221;) are ostracised and feared. The story opens at the annual Peace Fair, attendance compulsory, where caged idents are tortured to reveal the one real human. Kyle the central character, appalled by the cruelty he sees, is attacked as he travels home and his life changes forever. Brilliant characterisation and fast-paced action make this an enticing start to a new series.
