## Picture books

### [<cite>Millie shares</cite> by Claire Alexander](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/7065798?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(32815215)&QRYTEXT=Millie%20shares)

Toddlers can find it hard to share their toys. This sweet picture book resolves an all too familiar scenario with expert ease. Ideal for home or playgroup.

### [<cite>Meet the parents</cite> by Peter Bently](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/7077366?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(1583513)&QRYTEXT=Meet%20the%20parents)

This brilliant “user guide” for small children, who use parents as tent poles or foot rests, is set to become a classic. Full of visual jokes, Sara Ogilvie’s illustrations are a treat. Shirley Hughesesque.

### [<cite>Peck peck peck</cite> by Lucy Cousins](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/7079048?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(24792299)&QRYTEXT=Peck%2C%20peck%2C%20peck)

Lesser spotteds are rarely glimpsed in our gardens now, so look instead at this bright new picture book from Maisy Mouse creator. Encouraged by his dad, this little woodpecker pecks with rash abandon. In fact, he’s single-mindedly ruined the books we bought. Brand new and full of holes already. Disgraceful. Read it, peer through the holes, smile.

### [<cite>Oi Frog!</cite> by Kes Gray](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/7080441?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(36546328)&QRYTEXT=Oi%20Frog!)

Fed up with phonics? Well pity this frog. Hilarious. Hope Gray and Field publish a follow up soon.

## Short chapter books

### [<cite>Violet Mackerel’s possible friend</cite> by Anna Branford](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/7081409?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(32041976)&QRYTEXT=Violet%20Mackerel%27s%20possible%20friend)

If you want a change from <cite>Rainbow Fairies</cite>, Violet Mackerel is perfect. In this title she has just moved house, in <cite>Remarkable Recovery</cite> she has her tonsils out. A good re-assuring read for the newly independent reader.

## Junior novels

### [<cite>How to eat fried worms</cite> by Thomas Rockwell](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/7082001?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(1566012)&QRYTEXT=How%20to%20eat%20fried%20worms)

If you’ve read all the David Walliams try this disgusting book in which schoolboy Joe rashly accepts a bet to eat 15 worms in 15 days. Originally published in the 1990s, Tony Ross’s illustrations bring the characters alive for a new audience. Then try <cite>How to fight a girl</cite> and <cite>How to get fabulously rich</cite>.

### [<cite>Bully Bait</cite> by Michael Fry](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/7082942?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(1718660)&QRYTEXT=Bully%20Bait)

Stuck on a <cite>Wimpy Kid</cite> waiting list? This has cartoons, is funny and no-one else knows about it yet.

## Young teen

### [<cite>Dandelion clocks</cite> by Rebecca Westcott](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/7083628?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(33427383)&QRYTEXT=Dandelion%20clocks)

If you like Cath Cassidy, you must read this heart-warming novel. Rebecca Westcott finds touching humour in this moving and realistic tale of bereavement.

### [<cite>Rock War</cite> by Robert Muchamore](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/7087844?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(25521326)&QRYTEXT=Rock%20war)

In a complete change of genre from best-selling author of <cite>Cherub</cite>, <cite>Rock War</cite> is first of a new series. Published at the end of March, it looks set to appeal to a different audience. All the more fans for Muchamore?

## Older teen

### [<cite>Half Bad</cite> by Sally Green](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/7088562?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(33427384)&QRYTEXT=Half%20bad)

With a film already in the making, Sally Green’s compelling debut novel has been hailed by critics. If you’re not squeamish, get your name down quick before it’s published at the end of March.

### [<cite>Light</cite> by Michael Grant](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/7090156?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(266397)&QRYTEXT=Light)

If you’ve been hooked since <cite>Gone</cite> by Grant’s compelling dystopia you probably know the series concludes this month in <cite>Light</cite>. I can’t wait to find out if Astrid and Sam survive after life in the dome.

### [<cite>Running Girl</cite> by Simon Mason](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/7091134?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(31448705)&QRYTEXT=Running%20girl)

“Bone idle school slacker” Garvie Smith is the latest in a growing cadre of teen detectives. Warning, just one page and you’re hooked.
