### [<cite>Five Children on the Western Front</cite> by Kate Saunders](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/9510763?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(38546184)&QRYTEXT=Five%20children%20on%20the%20Western%20Front)

This is a gripping novel that projects the characters from Edith Nesbit’s <cite>Five Children and It</cite> into the First World War.

Crammed full with great illustrations, captioned photographs and quirky anatomical questions, this book may be short but you won&#8217;t put it down from start to finish.
