## Board books for babies

### [<cite>One little baby birthday</cite> by Richard Dungworth](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/4594736?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(31448167)&QRYTEXT=One%20little%20baby%20birthday)

[![One little baby birthday by Richard Dungworth](/images/article/one-little-baby-birthday.jpg)](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/4594736?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(31448167)&QRYTEXT=One%20little%20baby%20birthday)

The rhyming text makes this board book a pleasure to read aloud. With delightful illustrations of toddlers at a birthday party, it’s sure to please.

## Picture books for pre-school age

### [<cite>Oliver and Patch</cite> by Claire Freedman & Kate Hindley](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/4620025?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(44256279)&QRYTEXT=Oliver%20and%20Patch)

[![Oliver and Patch by Claire Freedman & Kate Hindley](/images/article/oliver-and-patch.jpg)](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/4620025?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(44256279)&QRYTEXT=Oliver%20and%20Patch)

Oliver feels lonely after moving to the big city until he befriends a little dog called Patch. A charming gentle book about friendship and responsibility, and the illustrations are lovely.

### [<cite>Goodnight already!</cite> by Jory John & Benji Davies](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/4622604?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(44256270)&QRYTEXT=Goodnight%20already!)

[![Goodnight already! by Jory John & Benji Davies](/images/article/goodnight-already.jpg)](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/4622604?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(44256270)&QRYTEXT=Goodnight%20already!)

Bear and Duck are neighbours with radically different biological clocks. Poor old Bear, looking drugged with tiredness and trying to sleep, is harassed by wide-awake Duck who wants to make cookies in the middle of the night. The illustrations are perfect, and the story is very funny.

### [<cite>I feel sick!</cite> by Tony Ross](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/4856359?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(283148)&QRYTEXT=I%20feel%20sick!)

[![I feel sick! by Tony Ross](/images/article/i-feel-sick.jpg)](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/4856359?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(283148)&QRYTEXT=I%20feel%20sick!)

The Little Princess behaves abominably then gets her comeuppance. So that all’s right then!

### [<cite>Please Mr Panda</cite> by Steve Anthony](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/4896323?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(44256305)&QRYTEXT=Please%20Mr%20Panda)

[![Please Mr Panda by Steve Anthony](/images/article/please-mr-panda.jpg)](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/4896323?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(44256305)&QRYTEXT=Please%20Mr%20Panda)

Superb picture book about doughnuts. It’s a perfect joy to look at and to read aloud, and how excellent to have another gem of a picture book to deal, without preaching, with the perennial question, “What do you say?”

## Picture books for older readers

### [<cite>I am Henry Finch</cite> by Alexis Deacon & Viviane Schwartz](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/4857673?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(44256784)&QRYTEXT=I%20am%20Henry%20Finch)

[![I am Henry Finch by Alexis Deacon & Viviane Schwartz](/images/article/i-am-henry-finch.jpg)](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/4857673?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(44256784)&QRYTEXT=I%20am%20Henry%20Finch)

Using red thumb prints and black pen marks, Viviane Schwartz creates simple images to translate this thought-provoking tale into something that children can understand. It’s a story about a little bird who thinks for himself, demonstrates personal courage and changes attitudes; a good starting point for philosophical discussions and is nice to look at too.

## Junior novels for 6 &#8211; 10 year olds

### [<cite>Romans on the rampage</cite> by Jeremy Strong](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/4858460?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(42903074)&QRYTEXT=Romans%20on%20the%20rampage)

[![Romans on the rampage by Jeremy Strong](/images/article/romans-on-the-rampage.jpg)](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/4858460?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(42903074)&QRYTEXT=Romans%20on%20the%20rampage)

It’s by Jeremy Strong, so you’d expect it to be funny. However, you might not expect the narrator to be a raven, or to learn lots of Latin words and details of Roman life as well too. What a triumph, hilarious and good for you!

## Junior non-fiction

### [<cite>Who’s in my family?</cite> by Robie H Haries & Nadine Bernard Westcott](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/4859991?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(14212289)&QRYTEXT=Who%27s%20in%20my%20family%3F%20%3A%20all%20about%20our%20families)

[![Who’s in my family? by Robie H Haries & Nadine Bernard Westcott](/images/article/whos-in-my-family.jpg)](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/4859991?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(14212289)&QRYTEXT=Who%27s%20in%20my%20family%3F%20%3A%20all%20about%20our%20families)

Easy to read book about the different ways we live our lives, how we eat, how we dress, and the amazing diversity of family life in Britain. “Approachable and open minded, cheery and straight forward.”

## Younger teen 11 &#8211; 14 year olds

### [<cite>Winter&#8217;s bullet</cite> by William Osborne](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/4695314?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(41339958)&QRYTEXT=Winter%27s%20bullet)

[![Winter's bullet by William Osborne](/images/article/winters-bullet.jpg)](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/4695314?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(41339958)&QRYTEXT=Winter%27s%20bullet)

Amsterdam, 1945 &#8211; 15 year old Tygo is working as a locksmith for a German officer, helping him to loot empty houses, and hoping to rescue his sister from the Nazis. He lives in fear of his life from both the Germans and the Dutch Resistance. It’s a gripping page turner, as was Osborne&#8217;s previous novel <cite>Hitler’s angels</cite>. Brilliant.

## Older teen 14+

### [<cite>There will be lies</cite> by Nick Lake](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/4694693?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(44635314)&QRYTEXT=There%20will%20be%20lies)

[![There will be lies by Nick Lake](/images/article/there-will-be-lies.jpg)](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/4694693?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(44635314)&QRYTEXT=There%20will%20be%20lies)

Nick Lake is such a talented writer, and his new title is already getting rave reviews. It’s sitting on my book shelf beckoning!
