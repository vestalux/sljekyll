## Picture books

### [<cite>The Queen&#8217;s handbag</cite> by Steve Antony](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/23264784?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(47619052)&QRYTEXT=The%20Queen%27s%20handbag)

[![The Queen's handbag by Steve Antony](/images/article/the-queens-handbag.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/23264784?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(47619052)&QRYTEXT=The%20Queen%27s%20handbag)

We’re so pleased to see another stunning picture book from Steve Antony. I love his limited colour palette, very patriotic. Even the end papers are beautiful and witty. In his first book, we followed the Queen around the sights of London. This time she follows a swan around the major landmarks of the UK. It would make a super Christmas present, because the production is of heirloom quality.

### [<cite>One thing</cite> by Lauren Child](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/23268274?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(5619754)&QRYTEXT=One%20thing)

[![One thing by Lauren Child](/images/article/one-thing.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/23268274?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(5619754)&QRYTEXT=One%20thing)

Charlie and Lola fans will welcome this new outing in which a trip to the sweet shop to buy “one thing” is coloured by Lola’s demands to count and to negotiate.

### [<cite>What a naughty bird!</cite> by Sean Taylor & Dan Widdowson](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/23271347?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(50742118)&QRYTEXT=What%20a%20naughty%20bird!)

[![What a naughty bird! by Sean Taylor & Dan Widdowson](/images/article/what-a-naughty-bird.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/23271347?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(50742118)&QRYTEXT=What%20a%20naughty%20bird!)

A scatalogical tale (toilet humour to you and me). This simple picture book is bound to be popular with young children, though less so for those of us who have ever walked under a bird. The illustrations by Dan Widdowson are full of character and humour. Let’s hope the two of them collaborate on more books soon.

### [<cite>There’s a monster in my fridge</cite> by Caryl Hart & Deborah Allwright](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/23299449?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(54089122)&QRYTEXT=There%27s%20a%20monster%20in%20my%20fridge)

[![There’s a monster in my fridge by Caryl Hart & Deborah Allwright](/images/article/theres-a-monster-in-my-fridge.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/23271347?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(50742118)&QRYTEXT=What%20a%20naughty%20bird!)

A few words of warning for you of feint heart. It’s not just the fridge…

### [<cite>Our big blue sofa</cite> by Tim Hopgood](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/23599867?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(1536660)&QRYTEXT=Our%20big%20blue%20sofa)

[![Our big blue sofa by Tim Hopgood](/images/article/our-big-blue-sofa.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/23599867?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(1536660)&QRYTEXT=Our%20big%20blue%20sofa)

Have you ever asked a child to stop jumping on the sofa? Yes? Well, you’ll certainly enjoy this cautionary tale and perhaps the children you share books with will curb their exuberance in future. No? Read it anyway, because it’s super – in a rather Lauren Childesque sort of a way.

### [<cite>Poles apart</cite> by Jeanne Willis & Peter Jarvis](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/23602392?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(1047058)&QRYTEXT=Poles%20apart)

[![Poles apart by Jeanne Willis & Peter Jarvis](/images/article/poles-apart.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/23602392?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(1047058)&QRYTEXT=Poles%20apart)

A polar bear embarks on a journey around the world to return a family of penguins to the South Pole. (They got lost at the North Pole whilst picnicking.) The story is a delightful read and just resounds with humour, It would be brilliant for topics about journeys, landmarks or countries too, clever old Jeanne Willis.

## Beginner reads

### [<cite>How the elephant got his trunk</cite> by Anna Milbourne](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/23797776?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(18220670)&QRYTEXT=How%20the%20elephant%20got%20his%20trunk)

[![How the elephant got his trunk by Anna Milbourne](/images/article/how-the-elephant-got-his-trunk.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/23797776?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(18220670)&QRYTEXT=How%20the%20elephant%20got%20his%20trunk)

Anna Milbourne has managed to retell the whole of Kipling’s story in just a few words, with the help of John Joven’s bright jolly illustrations. An excellent choice for children who are just learning to read.

## Short chapter books

### [<cite>Twit twoo: the owl who was nearly magic</cite> by Steve Cole](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/23800131?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(53435704)&QRYTEXT=Twit%20twoo%20%3A%20the%20owl%20who%20was%20nearly%20magic)

With just three sentences on each page, this amusing story about a less than perfect owl is absolutely perfect for children who have just begun to read unaided.

## Junior novels

### [<cite>Wilf the Mighty Worrier battles a pirate</cite> by Georgia Pritchett](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/23803220?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(51849545)&QRYTEXT=Wilf%20the%20Mighty%20Worrier%20battles%20a%20pirate)

This enchanting tale of kindness and late flowering romance, in which Mr Cleghorn saves a baby seal from being shot, is enhanced by Judith Kerr’s sweet and evocative pencil drawings. This short novel is a joy to read; another candidate for your Christmas list?
