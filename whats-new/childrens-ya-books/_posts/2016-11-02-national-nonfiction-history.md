The Federation of Children’s Book Groups (FCBG) are celebrating National Non-Fiction November this month.

We have listed a selection of these books you can borrow from Suffolk libraries, covering the topics of history, English and general knowledge. [We also have a list of books on the natural world, animals, science and geography](/new-suggestions/childrens-ya-books/national-nonfiction-science/).
