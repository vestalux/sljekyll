Don’t peg the baby on the washing line, don’t give the baby to a kangaroo or wrap him brown paper and post him. Sensible rules all of them, I’m sure you’ll agree!

### [<cite>The Best birthday present ever!</cite> by Ben Mantle](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/12762730?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(44257187)&QRYTEXT=The%20best%20birthday%20present%20ever!)

Subtitled “and other unsuitable pets”, this witty picture book has an old fashioned charm about it. The unsuitability of each pet is described like a joke, with a warm-up followed by the punch line. For example, the elephant who sits sweetly being to read to on one double page spread, whilst on the next he tumbles through the floor.

Aimed at children who are reading with some support, this little story about a spider is one of Franklin Watts&#8217; <cite>Tadpole</cite> series, so it uses an easy-to-read, large, clear type. At 21 pages it could be read in one sitting.

## Junior fiction

### [<cite>Boyface and the uncertain ponies</cite> by James Campbell](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/12766393?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(44256307)&QRYTEXT=Boyface%20and%20the%20uncertain%20ponies)

I was completely hooked by this excellent debut novel in which Ade and his mum are left stranded in a tower block, whilst all around them their city falls prey to a fungal organism, the Blucher. The setting is bleak, but the over-riding theme of the novel is book is the redemptive power of friendship, trust and compassion. A brilliant read and I hope it wins lots of awards. Has shades of John Wyndham <cite>The Triffids</cite>.

A suite of likeable characters and a fast paced plot set in New York in the 1880s are the backdrop for this crime thriller about the young Houdini. Isn’t it a let-down when you finish a real page turner? But great to then discover more books in the pipeline. Pity we’ll have to wait till May.
