<h3><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/11833667?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(62311493)&amp;QRYTEXT=Portly%20Pig"><cite>Portly Pig</cite> by Axel Scheffler</a></h3>

<p class="mt0">If you’ve been to Ipswich recently you may have noticed a joyous collection of pig sculptures dotted about the town. If you haven’t, and you’re feeling left out, just stroll down to your local library and borrow this latest witty board book from Axel Scheffler. It’s a perfect piece of poetry, written in an A-B-A-B rhyme scheme. Axel Scheffler is such a talented illustrator he makes his pig look worried, cross or blissfully happy with just a few on his snout and a dot for an eye. But be warned, the book has a sound button which should never be pressed in an open-plan office.</p>

<p class="mt0">Following a fall, Ivy and Seb’s grandmother is rushed to hospital, where a bracelet has to be cut from her broken arm; that little snip unleashes some frightening characters from a parallel universe. But as the children discover, it is the parallel universe from which their grandmother came and the rules are different there. If you like Harry Potter books, you should enjoy <cite>The Crooked Sixpence</cite> with its subterranean London, in fact you might imagine you have walked into a parallel Diagon Alley. It’s a fast-paced, substantial and exciting adventure, perfect for holiday reading. And if it hooks you in, you’ll be pleased to know that it’s the first of a new fantasy series called <cite>The Uncommoners</cite>.</p>

<p class="mt0">This warm, humorous novel about 10 year Erica who finds an elephant on the doorstep of her small terrace house, is charmingly old-fashioned. Illustrated throughout this would make a great quick read for the last week of term.

<p class="mt0">Already longlisted for The Guardian Children’s Fiction Prize, this is a brilliant story about an enterprising boy who saves his family’s café and their Italian heritage. Just like the author’s first book, <cite>Cowgirl</cite>, it’s set in South Wales and is a super read.</p>

<p class="mt0">With a front cover slogan “Save the world? I can’t even get picked for football”, this hilarious spoof is a laugh-aloud read. Written by the award winning author of My brother is a super-hero, it includes a link to a <cite>My Brother is a super-hero game</cite> from the App Store. If you now regret booking a holiday in the UK before consulting a weather forecast, take this book to cheer yourselves up. Almost 300 pages should keep a family going through several days of torrential rain.</p>

<p class="mt0">An exquisite illustrated re-telling of the migratory patterns of the Godwit. It’s a beautiful book, and with so many Godwits visiting the Suffolk coast, it’s a most appropriate addition to our stock of non-fiction books for children. Gorgeous.</p>
