Those playful skeletons are still in occupation down a dark, dark staircase in a dark, dark house. They’ve been there since 1980, but I suppose in skeleton years, 35 years is no time at all.

An introduction in rhyme, witches, broomsticks and more. But be warned, it is rather long.

### [<cite>Spells</cite> by Emily Gravett](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/13379666?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(245669)&QRYTEXT=Spells)

Spooky it isn’t, despite the title, but then Spot is just too cute to be spooky, even when he dresses up.

“When Wilbur the cat accidentally smashes one of Winnie&#8217;s vases he hides to evade suspicion and Winnie begins to think her house must be haunted. She instigates what she thinks is a spell to fix a haunted house but ends up instead filling her house with skeletons, ghosts, spiders, bats and owls.” The Times calls it “pure magic” and we think it would go down well with KS1.

“A haunted house, a pattering mouse, a spooky feeling, a spider-webbed ceiling, a squeaking door, a creaking floor, a swooping bat, the eyes of a cat, a dreadful dream, a distant scream. A ghost that goes &#8216;BOO&#8217; and you!”
