> "12-year-old Ambrose is a glass-half-full kind of guy. A self-described 'friendless nerd,' he moves from place to place every couple of years with his overprotective mother, Irene. When some bullies at his new school almost kill him by slipping a peanut into his sandwich, Ambrose is philosophical."
