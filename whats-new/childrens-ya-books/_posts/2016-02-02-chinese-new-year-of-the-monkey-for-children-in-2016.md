## Board books about monkeys

### [<cite>Hug</cite> by Jez Alborough](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/9124483?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(697201)&QRYTEXT=Hug)

How can a book with just three words (“Bobo”, “mummy” and most frequently of all “Hug”) evoke such tenderness and pathos? Because Jez Alborough is a genius, that’s why.

### [<cite>How to feed your cheeky monkey</cite> by Jane Clarke and Georgie Birkett](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/9125159?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(50742120)&QRYTEXT=How%20to%20feed%20your%20cheeky%20monkey)

There’s a jauntiness to the rhyming text in this funny board book, which documents the daily routines of the average toddler.

A good sturdy touchy-feely board book from Ladybird. And it rhymes too.

A little girl and her monkey toy swing through this book visiting and copying the animals they meet in Emily Gravett’s first book. It won her a New Illustrator award and feels as fresh today as it did back in 2007. It’s a delight from the off.
