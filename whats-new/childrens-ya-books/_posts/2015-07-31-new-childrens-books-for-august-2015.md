## Board books

### [<cite>Where&#8217;s Bear?</cite> by Emily Gravett](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/16313086?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(46118962)&QRYTEXT=Where%27s%20Bear%3F)

[![Where's Bear? by Emily Gravett](/images/article/wheres-bear.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/16313086?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(46118962)&QRYTEXT=Where%27s%20Bear%3F)

We were very pleased to see these charming picture books available in board book format for the youngest of library users. Hare and Bear’s friendship is endearing and Emily Gravett’s beautiful illustrations are full of love, humour and a dash of surprise.

### [<cite>Farm</cite> by Laura Green and Sophie Hinton](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/16313830?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(68574)&QRYTEXT=Farm)

[![Farm by Laura Green and Sophie Hinton](/images/article/peek-a-boo-farm.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/16313830?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(68574)&QRYTEXT=Farm)

This is one of four board book titles inspired by the Animaru app for children. It’s great for playing odd-one-out games and for sparking conversations with the very young. Each page has 8 identical pictures, with a die cut hole over the 9th odd one. These sturdy little books are a super addition to our board book range and we hope they will withstand the test of our youngest customers. Oh and the other titles in the series? Jungle, Sea and Snow.

## Picture books

### [<cite>Shouty Arthur at the seaside</cite> by Angie Morgan](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/16364519?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(50447522)&QRYTEXT=Shouty%20Arthur%20at%20the%20seaside)

[![Shouty Arthur at the seaside by Angie Morgan](/images/article/shouty-arthur-at-the-seaside.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/16364519?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(50447522)&QRYTEXT=Shouty%20Arthur%20at%20the%20seaside)

Just in time for summer on the beach comes this second book about Shouty Arthur, whose over-exuberance always land him in trouble. A good choice to read with energetic boys (or girls) before your seaside trip. Angie Morgan’s illustrations are a perfect match for her text, with an interesting mix of collage and drawing. She combines humour, emotions, and a crab hidden on each double page spread.

### [<cite>Dino-daddy</cite> by Mark Sperring & Sam Lloyd](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/16366214?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(50193114)&QRYTEXT=Dino-Daddy)

[![Dino-daddy by Mark Sperring and Sam Lloyd](/images/article/dino-daddy.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/16366214?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(50193114)&QRYTEXT=Dino-Daddy)

This lovely picture book came out a few weeks ago, but we just have to give it a mention. It’s not just any other picture book about dinosaurs, it’s a Sperring and Smallman picture book about dinosaurs. Our favourite double page spread is either the “3000 urgent emails vs chair racing” or the “lets decorate daddy whilst he sleeps” spread. Hmmm. How to choose?

### [<cite>Grumbug!</cite> by Adam Stower](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/16368537?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(9685305)&QRYTEXT=Grumbug)

[![Grumbug! by Adam Stower](/images/article/grumbug.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/16368537?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(9685305)&QRYTEXT=Grumbug)

Oliver and his friend Troll were so busy in their café (for trolls), they didn’t notice that Oliver’s little sister Dolly had followed a squirrel to Munch Mountain, home of the enormous Grumbug. Tension rises to a hilarious climax before subsiding to a satisfying resolution.

## Picture books for older readers

### [<cite>Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland</cite> by Lewis Carroll & Tony Ross](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/16373724?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(41638)&QRYTEXT=Alice%27s%20adventures%20in%20Wonderland)

[![Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll and Tony Ross](/images/article/alices-adventures-in-wonderland-tony-ross.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/16373724?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(41638)&QRYTEXT=Alice%27s%20adventures%20in%20Wonderland)

Tony Ross illustrated Alice back in 1993, and here it is re-issued for a new generation of children, since it&#8217;s the 150th year since Carroll’s classic first appeared. Ross says in his introduction that he has “tried to make the story easier for young children to understand, whilst retaining the spirit of the original.” And of course he has, in wonderful Rossesque style.

## Beginner Reads and Short Chapter books

### [<cite>A brush with danger</cite> by Adam Frost](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/16377080?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(50742736)&QRYTEXT=A%20brush%20with%20danger)

First in a new animal detective series, this is exciting and full of cool gadgets. Wily Fox the detective gets to drive a flying Vespa that comes when he whistles. Illustrations by the aptly named Emily Fox appear on every page, with cartoons, maps and plans. He and his pals have a full cast of baddies to outwit, so Wily Fox is kept busy. Once he’s caught his breath, I think he’ll be back soon for another thrilling instalment.

## Junior novels

### [<cite>Katy</cite> by Jacqueline Wilson](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/20376088?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(481603)&QRYTEXT=Katy)

Based on <cite>What Katy Did</cite>, I won’t read it now as there is a waiting list, but Jacqueline Wilson has said “The nineteenth century children’s classic <cite>What Katy Did</cite> was one of my favourite books when I was young. I’ve reworked Katy, setting it in modern times, mirroring the funny first half of the story but with a much more realistic ending. I hope all the real-life Katys will approve!”

### [<cite>The strange tale of the snake ring</cite> by John Holroyd](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/16384549?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(50743348)&QRYTEXT=The%20strange%20tale%20of%20the%20snake%20ring)

Brilliant follow-up novel about the family who moved to a Cornish village. This episode sees them move out of their cottage after a storm damages the roof to a remote holiday house where adventure awaits.

### [<cite>The terrible two</cite> by Mac Barnett & John Jory](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/16394007?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(47114291)&QRYTEXT=The%20terrible%20two)

[![The terrible two by Mac Barnett and John Jory](/images/article/the-terrible-two.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/16394007?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(47114291)&QRYTEXT=The%20terrible%20two)

When he moved to Yawnee Valley with its hundreds of cows and not much else, Miles had to leave behind “his reputation as his school’s biggest prankster which he’d earned through years of hard work and brilliant thinking”, and life looked dull, dull, dull. Then he met Niles. Kevin Cornell’s black and white (and more black) illustrations make this the perfect comic novel. No wonder Jeff Kinney likes it!

### [<cite>The unlikely adventures of Mabel Jones</cite> by Will Mabbitt & Ross Collins](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/16395479?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(52926233)&QRYTEXT=The%20unlikely%20adventures%20of%20Mabel%20Jones)

Feisty heroine meets blood-thirsty beasts and dreadful pirates in this imaginative adventure. On a quest to find the X, Mabel sails on the Feroshus Maggot, meets the Psychopomp and the Omynus Hush and ends up sailing past flooded London landmarks. Ross Collins’ illustrations are suitably gruesome.

This book is so good, <a href="http://worldofhamish.com/">it’s already got its own website</a>. For 10 year old Hamish (inhabitant of the fourth most boring town), life gets much more interesting when the rest of the world starts pausing for a few minutes at a time. What would you do if you had a few minutes no-one else knew about? Hamish plans private trips to the sweetshop and other pranks, until life gets much more serious when he discovers that monstrous creatures called The Terribles are planning to take over the world. It’s a rip-roaring adventure, packed with disgusting monsters, ridiculous names and a band of children (the PDFs) who try save the world. Frank Cottrell Boyce said of it “HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!” and I quite agree. Rumour has it that Danny Wallace has written another Hamish story due out in 2016. Good. <a href="https://fe.bolindadigital.com/wldcs_bol_fo/b2i/productDetail.html?productId=BOL_125271&fromPage=1&b2bSite=4172">Also available as an eAudio book</a>.

Excellent, well illustrated guide to the sewing machine. After a clear and simple explanation of how the machine works, how to fill the bobbin and thread the needle, it gives a complete sewing workout of stitches followed by loads of interesting little projects. This book zings and will I’m sure be as useful for adults coming new to sewing with a machine, as well as the children it was intended for. Good old DK! We’ve recently been able to buy some super DK titles, so check our website to borrow a copy of the brilliant Eyewitness Guides to Dinosaur, The Seaside, Pirates and many more.
