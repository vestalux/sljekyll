<cite>The Ever Never Handbook</cite> is a tongue-in-cheek look at fairytales. A spin-off of the <cite>New York Times</cite> bestselling series <cite>The School for Good and Evil</cite>, it was always going to be good. Trust me when I say that you will never see your favourite fairytale characters in the same light again.

Fans of the series will be delighted as they can discover all the secrets of the school and find out what really happened in the last year of school for Sophie and Agatha (the main characters of the series).

With a fan-favourite character, Hester, telling you all the things the official pamphlet doesn’t want you to know, the book gives a sense of magic, mystery and madcap mayhem. Perfect for fans of fantasy YA and anyone that loves fairytales.

This handbook is a personal guide to help students to the top of their class. It helps with a range of topics: from surviving Uglification, to picking your own sidekick or henchman, or earning a part in the yearly school musical and so much more. And of course, it’s in glorious full colour and duotone because in the School for Good and Evil, very little is as clear-cut as simply being black-and-white.
