![The secret garden by F Hodgson Burnett](/images/featured/featured-the-secret-garden.jpg)

This is a children’s classic that has stood the test of time.

It was first published in 1911, but the story is as fresh and emotional as when the author put pen to paper.

This simple story will appeal to both children and adults alike. Once read, it’s one of those books you go back and read time and time again. My copy is dusted off every few years and I sit with total enjoyment and loose myself in the wonderful world of the secret garden.

Mary is a disagreeable orphan from India who moves to a remote house on the bleak Yorkshire moors. Wandering in the gardens Mary discovers a walled garden, which seems to have no way into it. How Mary finds her way into the garden, the growth of blossoming friendships and the magic of the secret garden will capture your imagination and hearts.

The love of this story is shared by my 17 year old son, who saw me with my copy in my hand: “That’s a brilliant story, the film is brilliant too,” was his verdict. For a child with dyslexia I take that as a compliment to the author. He used to listen to it as a child on tape and CD over and over again. He has only started to enjoy reading in the last few years &#8211; so I take my hat off to F. Hodgson Burnett and her skill as an author.
