Every day until Christmas Eve, a member of Suffolk Libraries staff will reveal a book, CD or DVD they will be giving as a Christmas present, and why. Today, Bury St Edmunds Library assistant manager Gill Turner recommends <cite>A Visit From St Nicholas</cite>, or, as it's more commonly known, <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1651533"><cite>The Night Before Christmas</cite></a>, by Clement C. Moore.

<cite>A Visit from St. Nicholas</cite>, or as it is more commonly known, <cite>The Night Before Christmas<cite>, was written in 1822 and has become one of the best-known poems in the English language. I would rather give the original text, a poem written by Clement C. Moore, than a more modern or updated version.

This poem has become a much-loved favourite for many families through all the generations. Settle down in a cosy chair with the children, snuggle up and bring the magic of a traditional Christmas. Every child and adult will enjoy sharing this book on Christmas Eve, young and old. Itâ€™s timeless.
