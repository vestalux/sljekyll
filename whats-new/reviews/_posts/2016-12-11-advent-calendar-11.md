Every day until Christmas Eve, a member of Suffolk Libraries staff will reveal a book, CD or DVD they will be giving as a Christmas present, and why. Today, Alison Catchpole from Gainsborough Library recommends <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=885520"><cite>The Polar Express</cite></a>.

I would definitely gift the DVD <cite>The Polar Express</cite> to anyone of any age who may be losing their Christmas Spirit.

The film is a fantastic look at how we see (or donâ€™t see) Christmas joy as we get older. It's full of mystery and intrigue and I believe it helps people to find some simple happiness in the recurring annual festival.

Its full of what you would expect - Santa, snow, presents and elves - but within it are also challenges, friendships and intrigue.

Polar Express is one of those films I watch to enjoy the festive season and it will certainly be going on in my house very soon!
