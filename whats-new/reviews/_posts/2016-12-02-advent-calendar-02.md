Every day until Christmas Eve, a member of Suffolk Libraries staff will reveal a book, CD or DVD they will be giving as a Christmas present, and why. Today, library and information advisor Emma Maguire recommends <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1239459"><cite>The Dinosaur That Pooped Christmas</cite></a>, by Tom Fletcher, Dougie Poynter & Garry Parsons.

In the words of the authors themselves – "If you’re a parent, and you’ve got a kid who likes poop, dinosaurs & Christmas ... it is literally the perfect gift for them!"

This book comes out of our Christmas box every year and our family read this book over and over again. We never get tired of it and it never fails to raise a laugh and a smile. I will be buying this book for several small people as a gift this year and hope it raises a smile in them too!
