Every day until Christmas Eve, a member of Suffolk Libraries staff will reveal a book, CD or DVD they will be giving as a Christmas present, and why. Today, Kedington Library manager Dawn Bamford recommends <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2056780"><cite>Ten Little Elves</cite></a>, by Michael Brownlow & Simon Rickerty.

Elves stop making toys to help Santa and have a little adventure with icicles, snowballs and all sorts of animals.  

This book is really happy and colourful with great illustrations and rhymes throughout. <cite>Ten Little Elves</cite> is the most festive way to count down from 10 whilst the Elves have little mishaps and but still save the day.

The other books in the <cite>Ten Little</cite> series are all great but this one is especially so.
