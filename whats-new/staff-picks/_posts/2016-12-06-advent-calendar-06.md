Every day until Christmas Eve, a member of Suffolk Libraries staff will reveal a book, CD or DVD they will be giving as a Christmas present, and why. Today, Bookstart administrator Kate Bacon recommends <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2052114"><cite>The BFG</cite></a>.

<cite>The BFG</cite> follows Sophie (Ruby Barnhill) as she is whisked away from her orphanage by the BFG (Big Friendly Giant) and taken to Giant Country where she is immediately at risk of being eaten by the other, larger giants, including Fleshlumpeater (Jemaine Clement) and Bloodbottler (Bill Hader).

Together, Sophie and the BFG go on an adventure to Dream Country where they capture dreams for the BFG to give to all of the human world's sleeping children. After coming up with a cunning plan, the pair head back to London to see if the Queen (Penelope Wilton) can help them tackle the problem of the bullying, child-eating giants.

<cite>The BFG</cite> is just magical, a sheer delight from beginning to end.
