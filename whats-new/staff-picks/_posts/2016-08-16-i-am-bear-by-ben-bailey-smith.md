This is a delightful picture book about Bear who has purple hair. The illustrations are bright, colourful and enchanting for children and adults alike. The gentle rhyme makes it easy to read with little ones and for older children to attempt on their own. I read this 4 times in a row to my 3 year old god-daughter, a sure sign that she enjoyed it.

For added fun, <cite>I Am Bear</cite> has its own website where Ben Bailey Smith performs the book to musical accompaniment. But be warned, if you watch it you may feel the pressure to maintain the same musical standard and ability as the author. Adults may recognise Bailey Smith in his guise of Doc Brown or as the occasional stand in host of the goodship Witter. I really enjoyed <cite>I am Bear</cite> and would definitely seek out any more books by him.
