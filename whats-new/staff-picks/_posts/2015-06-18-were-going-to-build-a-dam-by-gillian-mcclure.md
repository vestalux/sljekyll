What’s very striking about Gillian’s books, apart from the fact that they are beautifully illustrated, is they all look very different. Gillian says she &#8220;likes to search for a look that matches the underlying feeling of a picture book story&#8221;, hence her use of various techniques.

In <cite>We’re going to build a dam</cite>, she uses watercolour and wax crayon to illustrate the story of two resourceful little boys and a dog who attempt to stop a stream from running down to the sea. For anyone who has ever enjoyed messing about at the water’s edge, this is an absolute delight. Gillian’s pictures are full of detail and movement &#8211; under 5s are sure to love these books.
