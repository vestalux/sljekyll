Bernard Cornwell, OBE is an English author of historical novels. Two of his historical novel series have been adapted for television; the <cite>Sharpe</cite> series by ITV and <cite>The Last Kingdom</cite> by BBC. In 2014 he published a nonfiction book, <cite>Waterloo: The History of Four Days, Three Armies and Three Battles</cite>.

**Where did your interest in history and particularly military history come from? Did you have an inspiring history teacher at school?**

I had an inspiring English teacher at school, but the only history teacher I can recall was rather dour. I suspect my interest in history was inherited! When I was in my 50’s I met my birth mother for the first time and found her flat crammed with historical novels... so make of that what you will. I don’t remember a time when I wasn’t obsessed by history, from a child it was my favourite reading and I cycled miles to visit old churches, ruins, whatever. As for military history, I was adopted into a family of fundamentalist puritans, belonging to a sect called The Peculiar People (really!) and among the many things of which they disapproved was anything to do with the military so, naturally, I became fascinated by all things military.

**Where did the character of Uhtred come from?**

He has some basis in history – there was a family that frequently used the name Uhtred in the 8th, 9th and 10th centuries, and they were the owners of Bebbanburg, now Bamburgh Castle. My Uhtred is fictional, but I discovered the family by meeting my natural father, again when I was in my 50’s, and discovered that he was a direct descendant of that family. The surname had changed over the years to Oughtred, but his family tree (and mine) went all the way back to the Anglo-Saxon period. My curiosity was aroused by their holding onto Bebbanburg – a Saxon and Christian enclave in a Danish and pagan kingdom of Northumbria. I suspect they collaborated, but we don’t really know. Whatever, Uhtred is one of my ancestors!

**When you write are you a planner or do you get ideas of where to take the story as you write it?**

I don't have an outline. Some writers plot very carefully, and their books are great, but others, like me, leave it to instinct.

**Do you get much time for leisure reading or is it all research?**

I read a lot, and a lot that has nothing to do with history, though I suppose about half my reading is somehow connected to whatever period I’m writing about. I do like a well-written thriller – I’m a great fan of John Sandford – but mostly I read non-fiction. I’ve just finished <cite>Our Man in Charleston</cite> by Christopher Dickey, a splendid book about the British consul in Charleston, South Carolina, during the American Civil War, which I read mainly because he lived a few houses away from mine in that city. And I’ve just started <cite>The Incredible Unlikeliness of Being</cite> by Alice Roberts, and am loving it so far!

**Is there anything you can share about your latest project?**

The latest one, finished yesterday, is the 10th novel about Uhtred and, at last, he makes a proper attempt to recapture Bebbanburg. But will he succeed? I ain’t saying.

**Given a time machine and the ability to go backwards or forwards what date would you set the clock for and why? (assuming you could get back..)**

It would be nice to meet Nell Gwynne? And if you did, why come back? But I suppose if I was forced to make a choice I think I’d want to be in the Globe for the first performance of, well, almost anything! I’ll choose <cite>The Tempest</cite>.
