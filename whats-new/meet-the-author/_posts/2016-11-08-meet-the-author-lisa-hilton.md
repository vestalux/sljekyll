Sony Pictures acquired the novel's film rights prior to publication.

## 1. Who were your literary influences as you were growing up?

I was such a voracious reader that it’s difficult to choose. If I had to pick two writers who just enchant with their powers of language, who make you see what miracles words can make, it would be John Donne and Evelyn Waugh - but I’d never dare to think of either as an influence.

## 2. A lot of Suffolk readers will know you as the author of <cite>Wolves in Winter</cite>, set in Italy in the 15th century. At what point did you change tack to become the author of “the most shocking thriller of the year”?

It wasn’t a deliberate strategy - I was finishing a historical biography (<cite>Elizabeth: Renaissance Prince</cite>) and I wrote a novel that I liked, for myself. My agent hated it, my publisher hated it, and somehow that made me bloody minded. I tried to find a publisher for a long time, but when I did, I didn’t think anything much would come of it - I was just delighted to have my funny book out. And then it rather snowballed...

## 3. I hesitate to ask this but were any aspects of Judith Rashleigh based on anyone you know?

Well, naturally, it’s almost entirely autobiographical.

## 4. Were you an admirer of Artemisia Gentileschi before you started the book and did it take a long time to do the research on the art world?

I had studied Gentileschi in Florence on an art history course; she’d been in my head a long time. I had to do more research on how the art world is working right now, make sure that my information wasn’t out of date - I was really glad when a few people who work at auction houses said I’d got it just right.

## 5. Is there anything you can share with us about your latest project?

I’ve just submitted volume two of the <cite>Maestra</cite> trilogy, <cite>Domina</cite>, for publication in spring 2017, and then I’ll be completing the third. I’ve just written an essay on Cagnacci for a show at the Frick in New York, which was a very nice change of rhythm, and I’m thinking about a new non-fiction.

## 6. Do you have a message for your readers in Suffolk Libraries?

I had a Saturday job as a library assistant and was obviously always in trouble for reading when I should have been shelving. I am a passionate advocate of libraries, and the contribution they make to communities. Feel proud of your library, and proud of yourself for using it!

## 7. Can you tell us one thing about yourself that none of your readers would know?

I love HP sauce.
