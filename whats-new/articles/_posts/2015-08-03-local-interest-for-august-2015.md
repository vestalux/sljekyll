The Elveden Estate is a fascinating country estate which has developed to become a modern, multifaceted rural business enterprise. The estate&#8217;s extraordinary ownership story begins with Admiral Keppel in 1768-86, before passing through the hands of Lord Albemarle, the Newton family and the India Office, which owned the estate for the enjoyment of Maharajah Duleep Singh, and most recently to the Guinness family in 1894. Each owner has left his mark on the estate.
