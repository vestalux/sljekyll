[![Before Sutton Hoo: the prehistoric remains and early Anglo-Saxon cemetery at Tranmer House, Bromeswell, Suffolk by Christopher Fern](/images/article/before-sutton-hoo.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/7530328?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(56734997)&QRYTEXT=Before%20Sutton%20Hoo%20%3A%20the%20prehistoric%20remains%20and%20early%20Anglo-Saxon%20cemetery%20at%20Tranmer%20House%2C%20Bromeswell%2C%20Suffolk)

In 2000, a second early Anglo-Saxon cemetery was found at Sutton Hoo in Suffolk, 500m north of the famous royal burial-ground. The new burial-ground probably began as a folk cemetery where the rites of cremation and inhumation were practiced. Nevertheless, the findings suggest a wealthy local population in the period just prior to the founding of the mound cemetery at Sutton Hoo.
