Katherine Howard was the fifth wife of Henry VIII and cousin to the executed Anne Boleyn. She first came to court as a young girl of fourteen, but even prior to that her fate had been sealed and she was doomed to die. She was beheaded in 1542 for crimes of adultery and treason, in one of the most sensational scandals of the Tudor age. The traditional story of Henry VIII&#8217;s fifth queen dwells on her sexual exploits before she married the king, and her execution is seen as her just dessert for having led a reckless life. However, the true story of Katherine Howard could not be more different.

A poignant, and very personal childhood memoir of growing up in Cumbria during the Second World War and into the 1950s. A world of rationing where there were no sweets, no chocolate, no junk food. Education was free but few young people went to university. A more innocent age. Sunday Times columnist Hunter Davies eloquently takes us back to that period with this social memoir.

Another book about the 1950â€™s. This one is written by Pat Stewart who was immortalised by one of the iconic images of the 20th century. For years, an imposter named Norma Edmonton claimed to be the girl in the picture. After seeing Mrs Edmonton lying on <cite>The One Show</cite>, Pat Stewart stepped forward to reveal herself and tell her story. At the time of the photo 17-year-old Pat was a dancing &#8216;Tiller Girl&#8217;, and went on to high-kick her way from Blackpool Pier to the best (and worst) clubs in the West End. Over more than half a century in the showbiz industry, she became friends with some of the era&#8217;s great stars. This, finally, is the true story of the girl in the spotty dress.
