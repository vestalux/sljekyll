## [<cite>Sailing close to the wind: reminiscences</cite> by Dennis Skinner](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/11524304?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(44636361)&QRYTEXT=Sailing%20close%20to%20the%20wind%20%3A%20reminiscences)

MP Dennis Skinner, the famed Beast of Bolsover, is adored by legions of supporters and respected as well as feared by admiring enemies.

Fiery and forthright, with a prodigious recall, Skinner is one of the best–known politicians in Britain. He remains as passionate and committed to the causes he champions as on the first day he entered the House of Commons back in 1970.

A former chairman of Labour, current member of the party&#8217;s ruling National Executive Committee, Skinner&#8217;s parliamentary heckles and interventions are legendary. He was expelled so often from the Commons that suspension became an occupational hazard. This should be a fascinating read.

## [<cite>Coming up trumps: a memoir</cite> by Jean Trumpington](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/19953448?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(34790665)&QRYTEXT=Coming%20up%20trumps%20%3A%20a%20memoir)

In this witty, candid and fascinating memoir, the indomitable Baroness Trumpington looks back on her long and remarkable life.

The daughter of an officer in the Bengal Lancers and an American heiress, she became a life peer in 1980. Her life includes periods at Bletchley Park and as a land girl.

After the war she worked first in Paris and then in New York, on Madison Avenue, with advertising&#8217;s ‘mad men’. At 91 she is still a formidable force.

## [<cite>The man who couldn&#8217;t stop: OCD and the true story of a life lost in thought</cite> by David Adam](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/20906779?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(38546363)&QRYTEXT=The%20man%20who%20couldn%27t%20stop%20%3A%20OCD%2C%20and%20the%20true%20story%20of%20a%20life%20lost%20in%20thought)

Have you ever had a strange urge to jump from a tall building, or steer your car into oncoming traffic? You are not alone. In this captivating fusion of science, history and personal memoir, writer David Adam explores the weird thoughts that exist within every mind, and how they drive millions of us towards obsessions and compulsions.

## [<cite>Michelle Collins: this is me</cite> by Michelle Collins](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/20907184?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(38545667)&QRYTEXT=Michelle%20Collins%20%3A%20this%20is%20me)

Michelle Collins has played iconic roles in the two most watched soap operas on British television. In the 1990s she played the backstabbing blonde, Cindy Beale, in EastEnders, and in 2011 she joined the cast of Coronation Street and now plays much–loved Rovers Return landlady, Stella Price.

But what about the rest? Much of Michelle&#8217;s remarkable story has never been told before. From growing up on the wrong side of the tracks in North London with her sister and their young single mother to Michelle&#8217;s quest for success as she fought her way through some difficult and painful times.

## [<cite>Dearest Jane: a father&#8217;s letters to a daughter</cite> by Roger Mortimer](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/19960416?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(38359691)&QRYTEXT=Dearest%20Jane)

Following on from the hugely popular <cite>Dear Lupin</cite>, Charlie Mortimer&#8217;s older sister Jane Torday shares her own letters. As Roger Mortimer&#8217;s eldest daughter, she received hundreds over the years, containing the same wit, irreverence and poignancy as those to Charlie.

## [<cite>Tickling the English</cite> by Dara O Briain](http://suffolklibraries.lib.overdrive.com/8E8923A8-8E02-4058-A3F1-CDDEA660165A/10/50/en/ContentDetails.htm?id=972F0D6A-1C6F-49A7-B0BA-F360C7A69963) (eBook)

Nostalgia, identity, eccentricity, gin drinking and occasional violence… these are just some of the themes that stand-up comedian Dara O Briain explores in <cite>Tickling the English</cite>.

O Briain moved to England many years ago, but when he takes his show on tour around the country – from deserted seaside towns and remote off-shore islands, to sprawling industrial cities and sleepy suburbs – it&#8217;s clear to him that his adopted home is still a bit of an enigma.

Why do the English pretend to be unhappy all the time? Why can&#8217;t they accept they rank about 5th, in everything? And what&#8217;s with all the fudge?
