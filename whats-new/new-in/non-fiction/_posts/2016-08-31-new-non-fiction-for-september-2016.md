Elizabeth Jane Howard was an acclaimed novelist who is still fondly remembered in Bungay where she spent her later years and fought to keep her local library open. She is best known for the five-book <cite>Cazalet Chronicles</cite>, the latest volume of which – <cite>All Change</cite> – was published just two months before she died. The author has completed interviews with Howard, her family and friends and has had full access to the late author’s papers.

<cite>The Pigeon Tunnel</cite>, John le Carre's memoir and his first work of non-fiction, is a thrilling journey into the worlds of his 'secret sharers' - the men and women, who inspired some of his most enthralling novels - and a testament to the author's extraordinary engagement with the last half-century.

Coming face to face with an important illuminated manuscript in the original is like meeting a very famous person. We may all pretend that a well-known celebrity is no different from anyone else, and yet there is an undeniable thrill in actually meeting and talking to a person of world stature.

The idea for the book is to invite the reader into intimate conversations with 12 of the most famous manuscripts in existence and to explore with the author what they tell us about nearly a thousand years of medieval history - and sometimes the modern world too.

Christopher de Hamel introduces us to kings, queens, saints, scribes, artists, librarians, thieves, dealers, collectors and the international community of manuscript scholars, showing us how he and his fellows piece together evidence to reach unexpected conclusions.
