<p class="mt0">A classic tale from a former Mayor of Aldeburgh. This one has been described as the Holy Grail of Railway books. The style is from another age but it is highly readable and forthright. There are lots of funny and insightful moments, about railways, about management and life in general drawn from the authorâ€™s 40 years on the railways. This has been out of print for years so even if are not interested in railways it is an interesting curio.</p>
