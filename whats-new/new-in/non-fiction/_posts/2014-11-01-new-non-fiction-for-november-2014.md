[![A Field Guide to Happiness: What I Learned in Bhutan about Living, Loving, and Waking Up by Linda Leaming](/images/article/a-field-guide-to-happiness.jpg)](http://suffolklibraries.lib.overdrive.com/4408DF3B-07E6-4E4B-AE30-3735A88AB0CD/10/50/en/ContentDetails.htm?id=C1501D4C-CFB8-46C0-8FE7-0A58ACD1C88E)

Linda Leaming, a harried American traveled from Nashville, Tennessee, to the rugged Himalayan nation of Bhutan &#8211; sometimes called the happiest place on Earth &#8211; to teach English and unlearn her politicised and polarised, energetic and impatient way of life. Forced by circumstance and her rustic surroundings to embrace a simplified life, Leaming made room for more useful beliefs. This collection of stories, impressions, and suggestions is a little nudge, a push, a leg up into the rarefied air of paradise &#8211; of bright sunlight and beautiful views.
