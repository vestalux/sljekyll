## [<cite>Under one roof: how a tough old woman in a little old house changed my life</cite> by Barry Martin & Philip Lerman](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/11505570?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(32815709)&QRYTEXT=Under%20one%20roof%20%3A%20how%20a%20tough%20old%20woman%20in%20a%20little%20old%20house%20changed%20my%20life)

The heart-warming true story of the bond between a feisty octogenarian and the man in charge of building a shopping mall on top of her home.

Edith Macefield achieved folk hero status in 2006 when she turned down $1 million to sell her home to make way for a commercial development in a small neighborhood of Seattle.

It didn&#8217;t matter that her tiny house was surrounded by rubble and graffiti. It was home. Barry Martin respected that, and when he took the job as construction supervisor for the shopping mall that was being erected around Edith&#8217;s little house, he determined to make things as easy as he could for her.

What does it take for one woman to drive 10,000km around India a land where bullock carts vie for space with SUVs on eight-lane super-highways, where GPS systems fail to give directions, and where a blessing from the gods is considered better road insurance than safer driving?

As Vanessa Able learnt, all it takes is a little bit of gumption, a whole lot of patience, and the world&#8217;s cheapest car the Tata Nano

## [<cite>Branson</cite> by Tom Bower](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/11509129?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(36544971)&QRYTEXT=Branson%20%3A%20behind%20the%20mask)

Richard Branson gets the Tom Bower treatment. This biography is described as “the full story of the Virgin man: his friendships, his ambitions, his drug-taking, law-breaking and steam-rolling tactics. It is a tale of greed, ambition and ruthless self-creation.”

The reports and despatches of Eustace Chapuys, Spanish Ambassador to Henry VIII&#8217;s court from 1529 to 1545, have helped to shape our modern interpretations of Henry VIII and his wives.

In approaching the period through Chapuys&#8217; letters, Lauren Mackay provides a fascinating perspective on Henry, his court and the Tudor period in general.

Raising her from a fledgling, through adolescence and into her prime years, Windrow recorded every detail of their time living together – secretly – in a south London tower block, and later in a Sussex village.

This is the touching, intriguing and eccentric story of their 15 year relationship.
