<p class="mt0">This one has already been trailed in the recent interview Peter James gave to Suffolk Libraries. Fans of Peter James and his bestselling Roy Grace series of crime novels know that his books draw on in-depth research into the lives of Brighton and Hove police and are set in a world every bit as gritty as the real thing.</p>

<p>His friend Graham Bartlett was a long-serving detective in the city once described as Britain's 'crime capital'. Together, in <cite>Death Comes Knocking</cite>, they have written a gripping account of the city's most challenging cases, taking the reader from crime scenes and incident rooms to the morgue, and introducing some of the real-life detectives who inspired Peter James's characters.</p>

<a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/18347453?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(62077536)&QRYTEXT=Cycling%20the%20Earth"><img class="{% include /c/img-float-left.html %}" src="/images/article/cycling-the-earth.jpg" alt="Cycling the Earth by Sean Conway" /></a>

<p class="mt0">Sean Conway was stuck in a life dead end of his own making when he heard about a round the world cycling race. He was immediately inspired - but it was a huge undertaking and he'd hardly been on a bike in years. Could he really cycle all the way round the world, solo and unsupported? Six months later, after completing a punishing training schedule and packing up everything he owned into boxes, Sean was in Greenwich Park on the start line of the adventure of a lifetime. Soon he was way ahead of schedule, averaging 180 miles per day, and on course to break the round the world cycling record. But then disaster struck, and Sean was forced to confront the possibility that he may not be able to complete the race.</p>

<p class="mt0">Inspiring story of Farida Abbas, who in August 2014 was living quietly in the mountains of Northern Iraq when her village was taken by ISIS fighters. Overnight her life became a living hell. This is the story of what happened to Farida after she was captured: the beatings, the rapes, the markets where ISIS sold their female prisoners like cattle, and Farida's realisation that the more difficult and resistant she became, the harder it was for her captors to continue their atrocities against her. So she struggled, she bit, she kicked, she accused her captors of going against their religion, and then, one day, the door to her room was left unlocked. She took her chance, along with five other women, and set out across the Syrian desert.</p>

<p class="mt0"><cite>Born To Run</cite> tells the amazing story of the Tarahumara, a mysterious tribe of Mexican Indians who are reputed to be the best distance runners in the world. In 1993, one of them, aged 57, came first in a prestigious 100-mile race wearing a toga and sandals. A small group of the world's top ultra-runners and the author make the treacherous journey into the canyons to try to learn the tribe's secrets and then take them on over a course 50 miles long. This will appeal to runners and non-runners alike.</p>

<p class="mt0">In the 1950s, many of the women of Cambridge lived lives of great hardship, but every day their work as servants in the colleges took them into an extraordinarily privileged world. Known as 'bedders' they often became close to their charges: mothering them, covering up for them, sometimes even falling in love with 'their boys'. Revealing their stories for the first time, this book is a poignant account of these remarkable women's lives.</p>
