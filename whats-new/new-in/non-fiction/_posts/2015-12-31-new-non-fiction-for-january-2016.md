From the author of the food blog <a href="http://www.deliciouslyella.com">Deliciously Ella</a>, which has one million visitors every month from all over the world. Ella started the blog after being diagnosed with a rare illness called Postural Tachycardia Syndrome (PoTS), which left her unable to get out of bed and desperate to find something that helped. When conventional medicine failed, she turned to dietitians and overnight she gave up meat, gluten, dairy, sugar and anything processed. This is her follow up to her runaway bestseller <cite><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/1589207?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(49010809)&QRYTEXT=Deliciously%20Ella%20%3A%20awesome%20ingredients%20and%20incredible%20food%20that%20you%20and%20your%20body%20will%20love">Deliciously Ella</a></cite> in 2015.

When Shocks the donkey was left for dead on a farm in Ireland, no one ever thought he would make a full recovery. When Amber and her twin sister Hope were born 26 weeks premature, it was Amber who was separated from family and rushed into theatre for an emergency tracheostomy. Her parents were given the devastating news that she had cerebral palsy and would be unlikely to walk or talk. Then Amber met Shocks at the donkey sanctuary and their lives were changed for good.
