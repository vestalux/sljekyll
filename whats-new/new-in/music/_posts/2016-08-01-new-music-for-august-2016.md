<p class="mt0">Re-mastered edition of the album that followed the critical kicking the band got for <cite>Tusk</cite>. With hindsight, this would have been remembered as a fine album if they hadn’t already raised the bar with <cite>Rumours</cite>. There are some great moments on this one including <cite>Hold Me</cite> and <cite>Gypsy</cite> plus Lindsey Buckingham’s irresistibly catchy <cite>Oh Diane</cite>.</p>
