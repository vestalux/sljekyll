With Christmas just around the corner, we've picked out music for all festive celebrations on our online music platform, Freegal, [which you can access for free with your library card](/elibrary/freegal/).

**[She & Him - <cite>Christmas Party</cite>](http://suffolklibraries.freegalmusic.com/artists/view/U2hlICYgSGlt/32590013/c29ueQ)**

<cite>Christmas Party</cite> is the sixth album from the duo comprising Zooey Deschanel (star of <cite>New Girl</cite>) and M. Ward. Throughout the album is She & Him's signature organic stripped-down take on production: homespun charm perfect for the festive season.

**[Various - <cite>Ultimate... Christmas</cite>](http://suffolklibraries.freegalmusic.com/artists/view/VmFyaW91cw==/31252248/c29ueQ)**

It really will be the Ultimate Christmas with these 76 Festive tracks. Includes Wham! Frank Sinatra, Whitney Houston, Bob Dylan and many more!

**[Mariah Carey - <cite>Merry Christmas</cite>](http://suffolklibraries.freegalmusic.com/artists/view/TWFyaWFoIENhcmV5/23973896/c29ueQ)**

A mighty festive offering from the pop princess. Includes her renditions of <cite>Silent Night</cite> and <cite>Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town</cite>, as well as her Yuletide essential <cite>All I Want For Christmas Is You</cite>.

**[Susan Boyle - <cite>Home For Christmas</cite>](http://suffolklibraries.freegalmusic.com/artists/view/U3VzYW4gQm95bGU=/27947552/c29ueQ)**

The inimitable Susan Boyle sings a collection of Christmas classics including <cite>Little Drummer Boy</cite> featuring the Overtones, and two very special "duets" with legends of yesteryear: <cite>When a Child is Born</cite> with Johnny Mathis and <cite>O Come All Ye Faithful</cite> with the King himself, Elvis Presley.

**[Various - <cite>Christmas Hits</cite>](http://suffolklibraries.freegalmusic.com/artists/view/VmFyaW91cw==/25980732/c29ueQ)**

Old meets new in this festive Christmas album. With tracks from Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett and Elvis Presley as well Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears. Something for all ages.
