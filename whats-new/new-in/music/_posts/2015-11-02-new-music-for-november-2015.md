## [<cite>Montage of Heck</cite> by Kurt Cobain](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/24235480?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(57018275)&QRYTEXT=Montage%20of%20heck%20%3A%20The%20home%20recordings%20%5Bsound%20recording%5D)

[![Montage of Heck by Kurt Cobain](/images/article/montage-of-heck.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/24235480?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(57018275)&QRYTEXT=Montage%20of%20heck%20%3A%20The%20home%20recordings%20%5Bsound%20recording%5D)

A collection of demos written and recorded by Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain and released as a companion piece to the documentary of the same name. It’s a fascinating glimpse into the man behind the image. It is aimed at Nirvana fanatics but there are moments of more general interest. Cobain’s admiration for John Lennon is well documented and there is a version of the Beatles <cite>And I Love Her</cite>. There are also moments that nod towards early 1970’s Paul McCartney. By no means essential but an interesting curio.
