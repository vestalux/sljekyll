## [<cite>The 30th anniversary concert celebration</cite> by Bob Dylan](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/11133861?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(1682475)&QRYTEXT=30th%20anniversary%20concert%20celebration)

The talent on this CD is a snapshot and Who&#8217;s Who of rock and country legends&#8230;from 1992. Legends who were great then and are still great now. It&#8217;s not just Dylan … it&#8217;s Dylan sung live by Neil Young, Eric Clapton, George Harrison, Willie Nelson, Ron Wood, June Carter & Johnny Cash, John Mellencamp, Stevie Wonder, Lou Reed, Eddie Vedder, Tracy Chapman, Tom Petty, Johnny Winter, Richie Havens etc., etc.

This recording is a classic, a virtual museum of music greats at the top of their form singing songs by one of the greatest song writers of our era.

## [<cite>The take off and landing of everything</cite> by Elbow](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/11134727?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(12527979)&QRYTEXT=The%20take%20off%20and%20landing%20of%20everything%20%5Bsound%20recording%5D)

The sixth studio album from Guy Garvey and Elbow. Few bands can lay claim to a career that encompasses over twenty years. Even fewer can make that claim without changes to personnel, and, yet, Elbow in 2014 are the same as Elbow in 1992. Expect more beautifully crafted music, full of passion and melancholic tenderness. Q magazine claims this is their best album to date.

## [<cite>Out among the stars</cite> by Johnny Cash](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/11135192?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(35039762)&QRYTEXT=Out%20among%20the%20stars%20%5Bsound%20recording%5D)

On March 25, a lost Johnny Cash album will be released via Columbia/Legacy. Titled Out Among the Stars, its 12 “forgotten” recordings are not demos or outtakes. They were unearthed by the label and Cash&#8217;s son John Carter Cash in 2012, and include duets with both Waylon Jennings and June Carter Cash. Two tracks are credited as being written by Johnny Cash, <cite>Call Your Mother</cite> and <cite>I Came to Believe</cite>.

Produced by Billy Sherrill, the material was recorded at Nashville&#8217;s Columbia Studios in 1981 and 1111 Sound Studios in 1984. The restoration of the album was handled by John Carter Cash with co-producer/archivist Steve Berkowitz along with Carlene Carter, Cash collaborator Marty Stuart, Buddy Miller, and other musicians.

## [<cite>English oceans</cite> by Drive By Truckers](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/11135739?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(33426864)&QRYTEXT=English%20oceans)

After an uncharacteristically long pause, the band from Athens, Georgia return with <cite>English Oceans,</cite> their first new LP since <cite>Go-Go Boots</cite> in 2011. Also uncharacteristic is the fact that singer Mike Cooley, never the most prolific of the band’s primary songwriters, wrote six of the 13 tunes on the album, including <cite>Made Up English Oceans.</cite> If you haven’t discovered DBT yet they are certainly worth a listen.

## [<cite>Going back home</cite> by Wilko Johnson & Roger Daltrey](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/11136118?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(36216891)&QRYTEXT=Going%20back%20home%20%5Bsound%20recording%5D)

The former Dr Feelgood guitarist re-records blues classics with the The Who frontman.

G I R L is the second studio album by American recording artist and record producer Pharrell Williams and features the number one single <cite>Happy</cite>, nominated for an Academy Award thanks to its inclusion on the Despicable Me 2 soundtrack.

## [<cite>Hellios</cite> by The Fray](http://suffolklibraries.freegalmusic.com/artists/view/VGhlIEZyYXk=/28713225/c29ueQ==) (Freegal)

By pitching their music somewhere between the arena-friendly style of U2 and the mature pop/rock of bands like Maroon 5 and Counting Crows, the Fray rose to commercial prominence with their 2005 debut, How to Save a Life. This new album continues in their familiar style and features the single Love Don’t Die

## [<cite>Guilty of Everything</cite> by Nothing](http://suffolklibraries.freegalmusic.com/artists/view/Tm90aGluZw==/781676724727/aW9kYQ==) (Freegal)

Philadelphia’s NOTHING, formed in 2011 by Domenic Palermo, have been destroying the eardrums of audiences throughout North America for the past 2 years with a magnetic blend of captivatingly dark and beautiful vocals and explosive, blown out, in the red guitar fuzz.

## [<cite>Vagabond</cite> by Eddi Reader](http://suffolklibraries.freegalmusic.com/artists/view/RWRkaSBSZWFkZXI=/609224287206/aW9kYQ==) (Freegal)

Eddi Reader&#8217;s first new studio album for 5 years. Featuring the single <cite>Baby&#8217;s Boat</cite>. Recorded by Mark Freegard in Eddi&#8217;s hometown of Glasgow with a cast of well chosen musicians and friends eager to play their part in this, most captivating, deeply personal yet universal sounding album.

<cite>Vagabond</cite> was produced by Eddi Reader and features many of her long-term musical collaborators including John Douglas (Trashcan Sinatras), Alan Kelly, Ian Carr, Ewen Vernal, Roy Dodds (Fairground Attraction), John McCusker and Boo Hewerdine.

## [<cite>Is There Anybody Out There?</cite> by A Great Big World](http://suffolklibraries.freegalmusic.com/artists/view/QSBHcmVhdCBCaWcgV29ybGQ=/28674770/c29ueQ==) (Freegal)

The story of A Great Big World began in the crowded practice rooms at NYU. Ian Axel and Chad Vaccarino were both studying music business while fostering dreams of writing and performing on Broadway and beyond. Ian quickly saw potential in partnering with Chad, and started lobbying him to work together on new songs.

Their live performances showcased their deep friendship, and featured a warm, engaging interplay and theatrical touches reminiscent of artists like Simon and Garfunkel, Elton John, and most currently, FUN.

Features the hit single <cite>Say Something</cite>, with Christina Aguilera.
