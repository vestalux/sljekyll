## [<cite>Lazaretto</cite> by Jack White](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/14521134?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(38864961)&QRYTEXT=Lazaretto%20%5Bsound%20recording%5D)

Born the youngest of 10 children, raised in Southwest Detroit and a resident of Nashville since 2005, Jack White is one of the most prolific and renowned artists of the past fifteen years.

White has constantly reinvented himself, forming a “new band of old friends” the Raconteurs in 2006 and their debut album Broken Boy Soldiers showed a markedly different side, most notably one where songwriting, vocal and guitar duties were shared.

In 2009 White took to his original instrument, the drums, and started the Dead Weather with members of the Kills, Queens of the Stone Age and the Greenhornes. Releasing two albums in two years and unleashing a dark, captivating live show, the Dead Weather further-cemented Jack White’s musical versatility and range.

In 2012 White released his debut album Blunderbuss. You never quite know what to expect with a Jack White album. Why not borrow it and find out?
