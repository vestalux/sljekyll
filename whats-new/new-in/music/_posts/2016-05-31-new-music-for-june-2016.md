<p class="mt0">Is it really ten years since RHCP played in Ipswich? Ten years on from that June day they are back with a new album. It is said that the band scrapped at least two albums worth of songs and wrote new ones when it began working with producer Brian "Danger Mouse" Burton. Burton is very much the go to producer so this should be worth a listen.</p>

<p class="mt0">The world seems to be divided up into those who ‘get’ Radiohead and those who don’t. For those who do they will find much to admire on this album. It is more accessible and likelier to last longer in the memory than their last outing <cite>The king of limbs</cite>. This is one that benefits from repeated listens. Beautiful, layered with even a bit of acoustic guitar thrown in.</p>

<p class="mt0"><cite>Stranger to stranger</cite> is an experimental album that fuses electronic beats with African woodwind instruments, Peruvian drums, a gospel music quartet, horns and synthesizers. <cite>Wristband</cite> will be familiar to some listeners as Simon recently played this on Jools Holland’s programme. It tells the comical tale of a rock star prevented from entering his own concert because he doesn't have the proper wristband.</p>

<p class="mt0">First album in four years from Shirley Manson and co. This one promises a new musical direction and is less ‘fussed over’ than previous albums and more ‘cinematic’.</p>

<p class="mt0">Difficult third album from the Nottingham songwriter. <cite>On my one</cite> features a larger hip-hop influence with early sessions for the album recorded with Beastie Boys' Mike D.</p>
