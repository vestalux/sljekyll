## [<cite>Syro</cite> by Aphex Twin](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/22552947?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(43957642)&QRYTEXT=Syro%20%5Bsound%20recording%5D)

[![Syro by Aphex Twin](/images/article/syro.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/22552947?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(43957642)&QRYTEXT=Syro%20%5Bsound%20recording%5D)

Electronica legend Richard James returns 13 years after <cite>Drukqs</cite>. <cite>Syro</cite> features intricate electrofunk. Bubbling, watery tones dominate in the first track <cite>Minipop 67</cite>, whilst <cite>180db_</cite> comes across as more rave-inspired. The twelve tracks dip and dive, and build layer upon layer of varying repetitive beats.

## <cite>At least for now</cite> by Benjamin Clementine

[![At least for now by Benjamin Clementine](/images/article/at-least-for-now.jpg)]

Debut from the singer-songwriter and perhaps the best back story in the shortlist this year. Self-taught balladeer and formerly homeless, Benjamin was discovered in Paris while busking in the streets. Strange and beautiful. The vivid, royal shades that make up the stunning cover-art, featuring Clementine himself, echoes the rich, acoustic melodies of the tracks. This will have you digging out your old Nina Simone albums.

## [<cite>Architect</cite> by C Duncan](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/22553231?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(37819382)&QRYTEXT=Architect%20%5Bsound%20recording%5D)

[![Architect by C Duncan](/images/article/architect.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/22553231?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(37819382)&QRYTEXT=Architect%20%5Bsound%20recording%5D)

Exquisite, ethereal album. <cite>Garden</cite> is a favourite on BBC 6 Music, reminiscent of Fleet Foxes. This indie dream pop album seamlessly fuses lofty, chorale vocals with a folksy beat. Soft and murmuring There is a psychedelic shimmer <cite>On He Believes in Miracles</cite> and the title track.

## <cite>Eska</cite> by Eska

[![Eska by Eska](/images/article/eska.jpg)]

A distinctive singer. She effortlessly weaves together various musical elements: folk, soul, psychedelia and electronica, which she pairs with rousing lyrics.

## [<cite>How big, how blue, how beautiful</cite> by Florence + the machine](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/22553471?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(49561754)&QRYTEXT=How%20big%2C%20how%20blue%2C%20how%20beautiful%20%5Bsound%20recording%5D)

[![How big, how blue, how beautiful by Florence + the machine](/images/article/how-big-how-blue-how-beautiful.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/22553471?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(49561754)&QRYTEXT=How%20big%2C%20how%20blue%2C%20how%20beautiful%20%5Bsound%20recording%5D)

<cite>How big, how blue, how beautiful</cite> certainly lives up to its name. Welch&#8217;s powerful held notes and climatic articulation soar over bellowing, stripped-down guitar and drum bursts. Her debut <cite>Lungs</cite> was nominated in 2009. In the meantime she has gone from strength to strength headlining Glastonbury this year. Is 2015 the year Florence finally wins?

## [<cite>Matador</cite> by Gaz Coombes](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/22553599?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(15583404)&QRYTEXT=Matador%20%5Bsound%20recording%5D)

[![Matador by Gaz Coombes](/images/article/matador.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/22553599?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(15583404)&QRYTEXT=Matador%20%5Bsound%20recording%5D)

Former singer of Brit Pop rockers Supergrass, Gaz Coombes&#8217; new album Matador is a mature piece of work, with Radiohead influences. The English Ruse melds motorik stokes with clean, simmering one-note synth repetitions and harmonising, dubbed-over vocals.

## [<cite>Shedding Skin</cite> by Ghostpoet](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/22553719?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(47844203)&QRYTEXT=Shedding%20skin%20%5Bsound%20recording%5D)

[![Shedding skin by Ghostpoet](/images/article/shedding-skin.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/22553719?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(47844203)&QRYTEXT=Shedding%20skin%20%5Bsound%20recording%5D)

Obaro Ejimiwe&#8217;s third album. This is more instrumental and less electronic than his previous work. Obaro&#8217;s lethargic vocals blend beautifully with blunt beats. However in this album, Ejimiwe has turned away from multiform trip-hop and has moved on to moody alt-rock that ebbs and flows. Indeed, both thematically and lyrically, Ghostpoet has also widened his scope beyond the boozy meditations on a direction-less existence in the inner-city, which defined his early work.

## [<cite>In colour</cite> by Jamie xx](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/22553899?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(51337406)&QRYTEXT=In%20colour%20%5Bsound%20recording%5D)

[![In colour by Jamie xx](/images/article/in-colour.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/22553899?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(51337406)&QRYTEXT=In%20colour%20%5Bsound%20recording%5D)

Seven years in the making, <cite>In Colour</cite> was painstakingly put together in spare hours grabbed between work for Jamie xx’s band the xx, producing projects, and composing the score for a ballet. The electronic artist crafts atmospheric, relaxing music; making good use of vocal samples. The sound is expansive and anthemic, compounded of breakbeats and a pulsing synth.

## [<cite>Hairless toys</cite> by Róisín Murphy](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/22554003?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(51022348)&QRYTEXT=Hairless%20toys%20%5Bsound%20recording%5D)

[![Hairless toys by Róisín Murphy](/images/article/hairless-toys.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/22554003?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(51022348)&QRYTEXT=Hairless%20toys%20%5Bsound%20recording%5D)

There is disco, jazz and even some country on the third album by the voice of Moloko.

## [<cite>Are you satisfied?</cite> by Slaves](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/22554129?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(49561758)&QRYTEXT=Are%20you%20satisfied%3F%20%5Bsound%20recording%5D)

[![Are you satisfied? by Slaves](/images/article/are-you-satisfied.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/22554129?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(49561758)&QRYTEXT=Are%20you%20satisfied%3F%20%5Bsound%20recording%5D)

The loudest thing to come out of Tunbridge Wells for a while. The duo return with a reworking of 70s punk and blues-tinged pub-rock, featuring an inflection of British geezer hip hop.

## [<cite>Before we forgot how to dream</cite> by Soak](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/24256220?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(49981658)&QRYTEXT=Before%20we%20forgot%20how%20to%20dream%20%5Bsound%20recording%5D)

[![Before we forgot how to dream by Soak](/images/article/before-we-forgot-how-to-dream.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/24256220?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(49981658)&QRYTEXT=Before%20we%20forgot%20how%20to%20dream%20%5Bsound%20recording%5D)

A portrait of the trials of growing up, mixed with a mature dissection of her thoughts and feelings. It is hard to believe Irish singer-songwriter Bridie Monds-Watson is only 18. Monds-Watson&#8217;s tender, husky voice reaches spine-tingling, silvery notes that compliment a humming guitar rhythm.

## [<cite>My love is cool</cite> by Wolf Alice](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/22554461?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(51578262)&QRYTEXT=My%20love%20is%20cool%20%5Bsound%20recording%5D)

[![My love is cool by Wolf Alice](/images/article/my-love-is-cool.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/22554461?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(51578262)&QRYTEXT=My%20love%20is%20cool%20%5Bsound%20recording%5D)

Definitely one of my picks for the best of 2015. After a series of EPs this was eagerly awaited and did not disappoint. A powerful grunge pop/alt rock album with a range of eclectic tracks. Light, tinkling notes shimmer through <cite>Turn to Dust</cite>, whilst <cite>Bros</cite> features a tinny cymbal sound, and the rousing <cite>Your Love&#8217;s Whore</cite> has a heavier, layered rhythm.
