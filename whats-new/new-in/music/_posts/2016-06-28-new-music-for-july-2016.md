<p class="mt0">This is the long awaited second album from the Australian electronic band, a mere 16 years after their sample heavy debut album <cite>Since I Left You</cite>. The band describe it as a "road trip". This time around they have tried to re-capture the feeling of their teenage years of jumping in the car and hitting the road with a six-pack and heading out to the Australian bush.</p>

<p class="mt0">Natasha Khan gets into character as The Bride. This album follows the story of a woman whose fiancé has been killed in a crash on the way to the church for their wedding. The Bride flees the scene to take the honeymoon trip alone, resulting in a dark meditation on love, loss, grief, and celebration.</p>

<p class="mt0">Frontman Simon Neil recently described the new album as the "best record we’ve made... We wanted to force ourselves to take a left turn, keep ourselves guessing." This one has been influenced by recent hip-hop records, like the latest A$AP Rocky. A rockier sound is promised this time round.</p>

<p class="mt0">A former Sound of winner for 2012, his debut album <cite>Home Again</cite> impressed the critics and led to him being lauded as a great new talent - then he disappeared for four years... He returns with a new album produced by Danger Mouse and Inflo. It’s a bit different from his breakthrough record including tinges of gospel and Pink Floyd-type psychedelia.</p>

<p class="mt0">This should have been on the June list but it seemed a shame to let it slip by unnoticed. The album features all three surviving band members – Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith, and Peter Tork. The voice of the late Davy Jones is also included with a vintage vocal on one song, <cite>Love to Love</cite>, which was written by a Brill building era Neil Diamond. The premise of this album is what would happen if some of the top songwriters of today, Rivers Cuomo, Paul Weller, Noel Gallagher wrote new songs for one of the groups they admired? I’m not sure it all works but it is great to hear some new material.</p>
