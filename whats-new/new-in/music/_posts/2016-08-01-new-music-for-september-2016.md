This compilation is billed as "the essential Jack White songwriting collection." It is hugely unlikely that the White Stripes will ever get together again but for fans of the band this CD is some small compensation. Acoustic Recordings features a never-before-heard White Stripes acoustic ballad called "City Lights.". The recordings are alternate versions, mixes and previously unreleased recordings from White which also includes band The Raconteurs and his solo material.

Audio companion to Springsteen's forthcoming autobiography. There have been previous compilations but this will appeal to Springsteen completists as five of the album's 18 tracks have not been previously released. The compilation begins with two tracks from The Castiles featuring a teenage Bruce Springsteen on guitar and vocals.
