In early 1993, David Gilmour, Nick Mason and Richard Wright set up their equipment in Britannia Row Studios in Islington and created more than a hundred pieces of music. In 2014 David Gilmour and Nick Mason re-entered the studio and, starting with unreleased keyboard performances by Richard Wright, who died in 2008, added further instrumentation to the tracks, as well as creating new material. The result is The Endless River, including 60% of recordings other than the 1993 sessions, but based upon them.

## [<cite>Sonic Highways</cite> by Foo Fighters](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/9057935?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(43619782)&QRYTEXT=Sonic%20highways%20%5Bsound%20recording%5D)

[![Sonic Highways by Foo Fighters](/images/article/sonic-highways.jpg)](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/9057935?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(43619782)&QRYTEXT=Sonic%20highways%20%5Bsound%20recording%5D)

For this album, Grohl opted to make the experience as challenging and as uncomfortable, yet creatively stimulating, as possible. The idea: to record each track for the new album in a different studio in a different influential music city, allowing the vibe and collaborators from each location to infect and influence the song-writing process. And film it all. The result is Sonic Highways.
