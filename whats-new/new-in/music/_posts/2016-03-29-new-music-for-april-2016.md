Alex Turner and Miles Kane return with their follow up to 2008’s <cite>The Age Of The Understatement</cite>. This time round their songwriting was influenced by Isaac Hayes and The Style Council, as opposed to the Scott Walker influences of their first album.

Fran Healy and Travis have had two No.1 albums, five Top Ten singles, two Brit Awards and more than 8 million record sales in their career to date. The new album promises the ‘classic sound’ of Travis for their fans. First single release <cite>3 Miles High</cite> is an uplifting acoustic track, featuring backing vocals from up and coming Norwegian artist Aurora.

President Obama’s favourites return with their new album. Now that the nu-folk scene has faded will they be able to match their previous success?
