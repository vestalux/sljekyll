A new album from multi-platinum selling rock band Kings of Leon is a huge event. You may have seen them on Jools Holland’s <cite>Later</cite> programme recently. First single <cite>Waste a Moment</cite> has an anthemic feel to it. They are produced this time round by Markus Dravs whose credits include albums by Arcade Fire, Coldplay and Florence + the Machine. Dravs has a reputation for being uncompromising and his tough approach seems to have brought the best out of them this time round. KOL will be touring in 2017.

First new album from Billie Joe and the boys since their ill fated trio of albums <cite>¡Uno!</cite>, <cite>¡Dos!</cite>, <cite>¡Tré!</cite> in 2012. This is what the reviews would call a ‘return to form’ and sees the band back at their snarling best. It is reminiscent of their early work and short on ballads.

This is by Bowie in as far as it is the original cast recording of the show, created by David Bowie and Enda Walsh and inspired by the novel, <cite>The Man Who Fell To Earth</cite>. The sold-out production of <cite>Lazarus</cite>, starring Michael C. Hall, ran off-Broadway and received ecstatic reviews.

Standing alongside the cast’s interpretations of classics from his canon are the three final David Bowie studio recordings, co-produced by Bowie and Tony Visconti and recorded with Donny McCaslin and his quartet, the same band that played on Bowie’s last album. These last three songs — <cite>No Plan</cite>, <cite>Killing A Little Time</cite> and <cite>When I Met You</cite> — bring completely new dimensions to their cast counterparts.

Norah’s new album sees her return to her jazz roots. Over the course of 12 tracks, some of which are covers of Neil Young and Duke Ellington, the singer-songwriter revisits her piano sound. It is not <cite>Come Away with Me</cite> 2 as she is a more mature artist, but if you liked her earlier work you are probably going to like this.

Deeply personal debut album from another graduate of the ‘Sound of 2016’ list. This one covers Damien Rice/Feist territory. When you listen to this it is hard to believe that she is still only 17, fitting gigs in around her A-level homework. Billie was one of the artists at Latitude in July and is hotly tipped for success.

Australian guitarist and singer. She has an alt-country/indie-folk sound augmented by her rich, distinctive voice, and her playful, observational wit. For the past few years Jacklin has lived in a garage on the outskirts of Sydney, working on a factory production line making essential oils and honing this album.

The multitalented south London artist, poet, playwright and novelist has produced a follow-up to her Mercury-nominated breakthrough <cite>Everybody Down</cite>. Her debut novel, <cite>The Bricks that Built Houses</cite>, was published by Bloomsbury earlier this year and told a multi-generational story of drugs, desire and belonging in London. It became a <cite>Sunday Times</cite> bestseller. She has also had two collections of poetry published and was selected as a Next Generation Poet by the Poetry Society.

The new album contains three original songs, including title track and lead single <cite>Nobody But Me</cite> along with reinventions of classics: <cite>My Baby Just Cares For Me</cite>, <cite>The Very Thought of You</cite>, Brian Wilson‘s <cite>God Only Knows</cite> and a duet with Meghan Trainor on <cite>Somebody</cite>.
