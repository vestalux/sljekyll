## [<cite>Turn blue</cite> by The Black Keys](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/32471005?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(37689697)&QRYTEXT=Turn%20blue%20%5Bsound%20recording%5D)

Following their Grammy-scoring, arena-touring <cite>El Camino</cite>, <cite>Turn Blue</cite> has some pretty stiff competition. Dan Auerbach and Patrick Carney’s new album features their now regular collaborator Danger Mouse on production duties alongside the band and was recorded last year at Los Angeles’ historic Sunset Sound, with smaller stints in Benton Harbor, Michigan and Dan’s own Easy Eye Sound studio in Nashville. Hear the new album ahead of their headlining slot at Latitude.

## [<cite>Ghost stories</cite> by Coldplay](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/32469297?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(37690131)&QRYTEXT=Ghost%20stories%20%5Bsound%20recording%5D)

6th studio album by Coldplay, their first full-length release under Atlantic, after Coldplay were transferred from Capitol Records in 2013, following the purchase of EMI and its assets by the Universal Music Group in 2011.

The album is preceded by two singles: <cite>Magic</cite>, released in March 2014, and <cite>Midnight</cite>, released in April 2014. Coldplay are a band who inspire mixed reactions but this will be huge.

## [<cite>The Power of Love</cite> by Sam Bailey](http://suffolklibraries.freegalmusic.com/artists/view/U2FtIEJhaWxleQ==/28876669/c29ueQ)

Debut studio album by the English singer and winner of the tenth series of ITV&#8217;s The X Factor. Featuring singles <cite>Skyscraper</cite> and Compass the album entered the UK albums chart at number 1.

## [<cite>Sheezus</cite> by Lily Allen](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/32474017?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(37821475)&QRYTEXT=Sheezus%20%5Bsound%20recording%5D)

The irrepressible Lily Allen returns with her third studio album after her career break in 2009. Cheekily entitled Sheezus, as “a little nod to Kanye West”, who had released the album <cite>Yeezus</cite> in 2013, the album features the controversial single <cite>Hard out here</cite>.

## [<cite>Unrepentant Geraldines</cite> by Tori Amos](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/32477440?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(37819381)&QRYTEXT=Unrepentant%20Geraldines%20%5Bsound%20recording%5D)

While touring for her last mainstream release in 2009, Amos felt as if she had hit a block in her creative ability and needed to find a new way to make music. This led to her pursuing projects outside the pop/rock genre, including classical music and <cite>The Light Princess</cite> musical, as well as orchestral re-recordings of songs from her catalogue.

Feeling invigorated and with a fresh approach, <cite>Unrepentant Geraldines</cite> marks Amos&#8217; return to pop and alternative rock music. The songs on the album were, according to Amos, a long time in the making, exploring different styles and subject matter.

Amos stated she&#8217;d written the songs “in secret”, enjoying the freedom of not working in a large group of musicians. She described the album as different snapshots of her life and things she&#8217;d observed.

## [<cite>Someday world</cite> by Eno & Hyde](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/32484353?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(38359960)&QRYTEXT=Someday%20world%20%5Bsound%20recording%5D)
