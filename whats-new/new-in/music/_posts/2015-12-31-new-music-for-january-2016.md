Britpop veterans Suede return with a new album that they recently played to great acclaim at the Roundhouse. In the gig, Suede projected a film directed by Roger Sargent and written by Stephanie de Giorgio, with each narrative element operating as an enclosed promo to a particular song. Dark but fascinating.

One of the best new bands of 2015. Lo-fi garage rock with hints of 60s girl-group pop and the Velvet Underground.
