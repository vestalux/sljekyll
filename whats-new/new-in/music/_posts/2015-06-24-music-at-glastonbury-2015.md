Flamboyant indie rock queen Florence Welch will be sure to perform songs from her third, new album on the Pyramid Stage on Friday. We also have her previous albums, <cite><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/33894020?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(259265)&QRYTEXT=Lungs">Lungs</a></cite> and <cite><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/33891821?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(5631538)&QRYTEXT=Ceremonials">Ceremonials</a></cite>.

Whilst we anticipate Kanye&#8217;s next release, <cite>SWISH</cite>, set to be released this autumn, you can revisit his classics in our catalogue. <cite>Yeezus</cite> is his most recent, and we also have the <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14880-my-beautiful-dark-twisted-fantasy/">Pitchfork 10-out-of-10-er</a>, <cite><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/33888073?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(9299770)&QRYTEXT=My%20beautiful%20dark%20twisted%20fantasy.%20%5BCompact%20Disc%5D">My beautiful dark twisted fantasy</a></cite>. Kayne performs on the Pyramid Stage on Saturday.

[![Quadrophenia by The Who](/images/article/quadrophenia.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/31731913?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(9298999)&QRYTEXT=Quadrophenia%20%3A%20%5BCompact%20Disc%5D%20deluxe%20edition)

If traditional British rock is more your bag, The Who are performing on the Pyramid Stage on Sunday. Our favourite is <cite>Quadrophenia</cite>, the rock opera about 1960s mods.

## Our picks

<small>Here in the web team, we&#8217;ve chosen a few of our favourite acts appearing at Glastonbury this year.</small>

### Leon&#8217;s pick: [<cite>Grotesque</cite> by The Fall](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/31735551?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(94536)&QRYTEXT=Grotesque)

[![Grotesque by The Fall](/images/article/grotesque.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/31735551?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(94536)&QRYTEXT=Grotesque)

1980’s <cite>Grotesque</cite> is the Fall’s third album, and the first where they really hit their stride — a year later they’d release their masterpiece <cite>Hex Enduction Hour</cite>. Funny, poppy, ramshackle, spikey and to the point, it has some of Smith’s best lyrical moments. Highlights include trucker anthem <cite>Container Drivers</cite>, a kazoo-driven paranoid tale of wireless enthusiasts and government wiretapping called <cite>New Face in Hell</cite> and the deranged, 9 minute epic <cite>The North Will Rise Again</cite>. Although the Fall and Glastonbury is a seemingly odd mix, I’m sure it’ll be great fun. They will perform at the Park Stage on Sunday.

### Maddie&#8217;s pick: [<cite>Tough Love</cite> by Jessie Ware](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/31738884?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(17294879)&QRYTEXT=Tough%20love%20%5Bsound%20recording%5D)

[![Tough Love by Jessie Ware](/images/article/tough-love.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/31738884?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(17294879)&QRYTEXT=Tough%20love%20%5Bsound%20recording%5D)

An eclectic mashup of R&#8217;n&#8217;B grooves with smooth soul rhythms. With contributions from electronic producer Julio Bashmore and chart topper Ed Sheeran, <cite>Tough Love</cite> has a lot of talent hidden beneath Ware’s haunting vocals. The songs are perfectly chilled and subtle, some of my favourites being <cite>Say You Love Me</cite> and <cite>Sweetest Song</cite>. If you are looking for an album that relaxes and intrigues, then <cite>Tough Love</cite> should be on your iPod! Jessie Ware is performing on the John Peel Stage on Saturday.

### Emma&#8217;s pick: [<cite>Singles</cite> by Future Islands](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/31742913?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(16112012)&QRYTEXT=Singles%20%5Bsound%20recording%5D)

[![Singles by Future Islands](/images/article/singles.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/31742913?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(16112012)&QRYTEXT=Singles%20%5Bsound%20recording%5D)

Growling vocals, catchy synth-pop and captivating dad dance moves &#8211; what more could you want from a live performance? <cite>Singles</cite> is the most recent album from the Baltimore band, featuring the infamous <cite>Seasons (Waiting On You)</cite>, the nostalgic <cite>A Song For Our Grandfathers</cite> and the evocative <cite>Back in the Tall Grass</cite>. Be sure to see Future Islands perform on The Other Stage on Sunday.
