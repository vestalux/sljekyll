## [<cite>Singles</cite> by Future Islands](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/19964924?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(16112012)&QRYTEXT=Singles%20%5Bsound%20recording%5D)

If you haven’t had a chance to catch their performance on US television’s Late Show with David Letterman last month take a look. In an era of bland music on talk shows this was an extraordinary spectacle. Singer Sam Herring sings every note as though his life depends on it. Even Letterman – for whom most musical performances pass like commercials – exclaimed: “I’ll take all of what you got!”

## [<cite>Caustic love</cite> by Paolo Nutini](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/19966330?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(27343869)&QRYTEXT=Caustic%20love%20%5Bsound%20recording%5D)

You never know quite what to expect from Paolo Nutini and this new album is no exception. He exploded onto the scene in 2006 with his pop flavoured <cite>These Streets</cite> selling 1.5 million in the UK. Three years later he moved on again, with the acclaimed <cite>Sunny Side Up</cite>.

Brit nominated, Ivor Novello winner, he was the biggest selling UK male artist of 2009 and 2010. This new album showcases his maverick talent and incredible vocal prowess with a maturity way beyond his 27 years.

On this album Yanni adds lyrics to his beautiful instrumental melodies. Working with Plácido Domingo, he&#8217;s assembled a stellar line-up of the greatest opera singers in the world, including Katherine Jenkins, Russell Watson and many more.
