> "Feature-length comedy based on the award-winning TV series starring Jennifer Saunders and Joanna Lumley as the infamous Edina and Patsy. Causing mayhem and havoc wherever they go, Edina and Patsy continue to enjoy their booze-soaked, glamorous lifestyle when they find themselves taking the blame for a major *faux pas* at a trendy London launch party. Consequently hounded by the media and paparazzi, the pair flee to the south of France where they immediately settle in to the ways of lavish living. Despite being broke, the duo conspire a way to prolong their stay. The film also sees the return of Edina's daughter Saffy (Julia Sawalha), her exasperated mother (June Whitfield) and the oddball Bubble (Jane Horrocks). The all-star cast also features cameos from Kate Moss, Gwendoline Christie and Graham Norton."

Amy Mitchell (Kunis) is a 32-year-old, happily married, committed mother-of-two who works as a sales rep for a coffee company. But after finding out her husband is cheating on her, Amy becomes fed up with her stressful life and decides to take action. She quits the PTA in protest of its overbearing leader Gwendolyn (Applegate) and gets together with some of her fellow mothers for a wild and liberating night on the town. Along with town outcast and single mum Carla (Kathryn Hahn) and worn out mother-of-four Kiki (Bell), Amy hits the bars for an all-night bender that allows the trio to let loose in a wild, indulgent trip of liberation before deciding to make some important changes to their lives, including tackling Gwendolyn head-on"
