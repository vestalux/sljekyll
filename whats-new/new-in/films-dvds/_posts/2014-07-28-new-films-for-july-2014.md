The wicked Lord Business (Will Ferrell) is determined to destroy the Lego universe and rebuild it using glue – which goes against the very nature of Lego. Mistaken as the ‘Special’, the only surviving Master Builder, the rather ordinary Emmet (Chris Pratt) is selected to lead a group of figures on a mission to put a stop to Lord Business&#8217;s evil plan.

## <cite>Escape from Planet Earth</cite>

Children&#8217;s animated adventure featuring the voice talents of Brendan Fraser, Rob Corddry and William Shatner.

On planet Baab, Gary Supernova (voice of Corddry) is head of mission control at the Baabian Aeronautics and Space Administration (BASA), while his younger and more charismatic brother Scorch (Fraser) is the planet&#8217;s most famous astronaut.

The brothers are completely different, and even Gary&#8217;s son Kip (Jonathan Morgan Heit) favours his uncle over his father. However, when a failed rescue mission results in Scorch being held captive on planet Earth at the infamous Area 51 by Agent Shanker (Shatner), it&#8217;s left up to Gary to save the day.
