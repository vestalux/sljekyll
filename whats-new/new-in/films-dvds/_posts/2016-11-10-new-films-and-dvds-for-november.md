An intense rivalry quickly sparks between the two pets, with a jealous Max desperate to regain the attention he once had. However, the duo must put their differences to one side when cunning rabbit Snowball (Hart) begins to build an army of neglected ex-pets intent on getting revenge on all happily-owned pets and their owners. With the help of the other animals in his Manhattan building, Max must put a stop to Snowball's evil schemes before it's too late.

After overcoming doubts about his continued role in Starfleet, Captain James T. Kirk (Pine) leads the crew of the USS Enterprise as they continue to explore the darkest reaches of space as part of their five-year mission. Upon arriving for a routine stop at a remote Federation planet, the Enterprise is subjected to a devastating surprise attack by swarms of mysterious alien vessels.

After coming across alien warrior Jaylah (Boutella), Kirk soon discovers that the merciless Krall (Elba) is behind the attack and is readying an army to destroy Starfleet once and for all. Now facing a desperate battle to survive, Kirk must reunite his crew and find a way of defeating their frenzied new enemies before it's too late.
