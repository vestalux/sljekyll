This book was the subject of a frenzied bidding war and is the first of three psychological thrillers set in the art world, and has already been optioned by Columbia Pictures for a film adaptation. Heroine Judith Raleigh has been compared to a female Talented Mr Ripley, set in the glamorous and decadent worlds of London, the French Riviera, the Italian coast and Paris. Maestra follows the story of Judith Rashleigh, who works in a London auction house by day and a bar at night, who ends up in a battle for her life after stumbling across a conspiracy.

A sure fire bestseller. Take the ever popular Wilbur Smith and team him up with Tom Cain, a successful thriller writer. It may not feel like a ‘real’ Wilbur Smith book but he is in his 80’s now and he claims it is the only way to keep up with demand from his readers for new material.

A semi-naked girl wanders through the woods in freezing cold weather. When she finally reaches the road, a car comes out of nowhere and does not stop. By the time Detective Patrik Hedstrom receives word of the accident, the girl has already been identified. Four months ago she disappeared on her way home from the local riding school, and no one has seen her since. It quickly becomes clear that she has been subjected to unimaginably brutal treatment. And it&#8217;s likely she&#8217;s not the only one.
