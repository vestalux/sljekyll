Young Pip Tyler doesn&#8217;t know who she is. She knows that her real name is Purity, that she has $130,000 in student debt, that she&#8217;s squatting with anarchists in Oakland and that her relationship with her mother &#8211; her only family &#8211; is hazardous. But she doesn&#8217;t have a clue who her father is, why her mother has always concealed her own real name, or how she can ever have a normal life. An encounter with a German peace activist leads Pip to South America and The Sunlight Project, an organisation that traffics in all the secrets of the world &#8211; including, Pip hopes, the secret of her origins.
