## [<cite>Denial of Murder</cite> by Peter Turnbull](http://suffolklibraries.lib.overdrive.com/95846DAC-4B32-41EC-BBF0-95806874BE8A/10/50/en/ContentDetails.htm?id=C0673BB4-E32E-429E-8760-9DFEC4667A23) (eBook)

When the bodies of two murder victims are discovered within 24 hours of each other at the same location, each with a similar cause of death, the Murder and Serious Crime Squad of New Scotland Yard realise they must be linked. But how?

Vicary and his team are drawn into a complex investigation – one which will take them from remote cottages in rural Hampshire to the dark world of inner city sex workers, child abuse within north London suburbia, and the injustice of a long-standing wrongful conviction.

## [<cite>Backwoods</cite> by Jill Sorenson](http://suffolklibraries.lib.overdrive.com/95846DAC-4B32-41EC-BBF0-95806874BE8A/10/50/en/ContentDetails.htm?id=556C1502-F1C5-4175-AD34-8447F6B8D102) (eBook)

The more you trust, the more you risk…

When plans for a wilderness retreat with her teenage daughter Brooke go awry, Abby Hammond reluctantly pairs up with Brooke&#8217;s stepbrother and his dad, Nathan Strom, for the weeklong trek.

The only thing Abby has in common with the bad-boy former pro athlete is that their exes cheated with each other. That… and a visceral attraction that&#8217;s growing more complicated with every step through the picturesque woods.

Nathan&#8217;s wild-card reputation lost him his career and his family. After years of regret, he&#8217;s ready to fight for what truly matters-and that includes Abby&#8217;s hard-won trust.

When Brooke goes missing, Nathan knows he&#8217;s her best and only hope of rescue. But the deeper into the rugged mountains they go, the more dangerous the territory will prove-for their safety and for their hearts.

There is one standout fiction title in June. JK Rowling’s alter ego Robert Galbraith publishes another Cormoran Strike book.

When novelist Owen Quine goes missing, his wife calls in private detective Cormoran Strike. At first, she just thinks he has gone off by himself for a few days – as he has done before – and she wants Strike to find him and bring him home.

But as Strike investigates, it becomes clear that there is more to Quine&#8217;s disappearance than his wife realises. The novelist has just completed a manuscript featuring poisonous pen-portraits of almost everyone he knows.

If the novel were published it would ruin lives – so there are a lot of people who might want to silence him. And when Quine is found brutally murdered in bizarre circumstances, it becomes a race against time to understand the motivation of a ruthless killer, a killer unlike any he has encountered before.

## [<cite>Death of a scholar: The twentieth chronicle of Matthew Bartholomew</cite> by Susanna Gregory](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/20585042?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(40612606)&QRYTEXT=Death%20of%20a%20scholar)

In the summer of 1358 the physician Matthew Bartholomew returns to Cambridge to find his beloved sister in mourning after the unexpected death of her husband, Oswald Stanmore.

Aware that his son has no interest in the cloth trade that made his fortune and reputation, Oswald has left the business to his widow, but a spate of burglaries in the town distracts Matthew from supporting Edith in her grief and attempting to keep the peace between her and her wayward son.

As well as the theft of irreplaceable items from Michaelhouse, which threatens its very survival, a new foundation, Winwick Hall, is causing consternation amongst Matthew&#8217;s colleagues.

## [<cite>Elizabeth is missing</cite> by Emma Healey](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/14574889?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(36545180)&QRYTEXT=Elizabeth%20is%20missing)

A mystery, an unsolved crime and one of the most unforgettable characters since Mark Haddon&#8217;s Christopher. Meet Maud…

_Elizabeth is missing_ reads the note in Maud&#8217;s pocket in her own handwriting, and the one on the wall.

Maud&#8217;s been getting forgetful. She keeps buying peach slices when she has a cupboard full, forgets to drink the cups of tea she&#8217;s made and writes notes to remind herself of things.

But Maud is determined to discover what has happened to her friend, Elizabeth, and what it has to do with the unsolved disappearance of her sister Sukey, years back, just after the war.

A fast-paced mystery, an unforgettable voice: you will laugh and cry but you&#8217;ll never forget Maud. There is a lot of buzz around this title. Emma Healey is yet another graduate of the UEA Creative Writing Course.

When Red Cameron meets handsome, charming and rich Bryce Laurent through an online dating agency, there is an instant attraction. But as their love blossoms, the truth about his past, and his dark side, begins to emerge.

Everything he has told Red about himself turns out to be a tissue of lies, and her infatuation with him gradually turns to terror.

Within a year, and under police protection, she evicts him from her flat and her life. But her nightmare is only just beginning. For Bryce is obsessed with her, and he intends to destroy everything and everyone she has ever known and loved – and then her too.

A new title from the author of the bestselling Roy Grace series.
