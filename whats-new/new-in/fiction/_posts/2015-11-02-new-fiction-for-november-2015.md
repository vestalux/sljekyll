John Rebus returns from retirement. He wasn&#8217;t made for hobbies, holidays or home improvements. Being a cop is in his blood. So when DI Siobhan Clarke asks for his help on a case, Rebus doesn&#8217;t need long to consider his options. Clarke&#8217;s been investigating the death of a senior lawyer whose body was found along with a threatening note. On the other side of Edinburgh, Big Ger Cafferty &#8211; Rebus&#8217;s long-time nemesis &#8211; has received an identical note and a bullet through his window. Now it&#8217;s up to Clarke and Rebus to connect the dots and stop a killer.
