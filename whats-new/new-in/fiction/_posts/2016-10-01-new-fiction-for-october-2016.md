PD James died in November 2014. This volume collects together four of her best short stories which were specially commissioned for Christmas. P.D. James's prose illuminates each of these perfectly formed stories, making them ideal reading as we move into the darkest days of the year. While she delights in the secrets that lurk beneath the surface at family gatherings, her Christmas stories also provide tantalizing puzzles to keep the reader guessing.

Some of them are a great deal more extreme than others &#8211; as Virgil Flowers is about to find out.

As Bridget careers towards baby-deadline, tortured by Smug Mothers miming her ticking biological clock, a series of classic Bridget Jones moments finally leads her into pregnancy - but just not quite as intended. It's a pregnancy full of cheesy potatoes, outlandish advice from Drunken Singletons and Smug Mothers, chaos at scans and childbirth classes, high jinks and romance, joy and despair - but all of it dominated by the terribly awkward question - _who's the father?_
