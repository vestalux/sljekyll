His influence is everywhere. If you&#8217;ve ever been &#8220;in a pickle&#8221;, waited &#8220;with bated breath&#8221; or gone on &#8220;a wild goose chase&#8221;, then you’ve been quoting from <cite>The Tempest</cite>, <cite>The Merchant of Venice</cite> and <cite>Romeo and Juliet</cite> respectively.

If you “gossip”, the word comes from <cite>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</cite>. &#8220;The be-all and end-all&#8221; is uttered by Macbeth, and &#8220;fair play&#8221; comes from Miranda in <cite>The Tempest</cite>. &#8220;A heart of gold&#8221;? No, not Neil Young, you’ll find it in <cite>Henry V</cite>, while “the world’s mine oyster” is in <cite>The Merry Wives of Windsor</cite>. Elvis Presley in <cite>Are you Lonesome Tonight</cite> says &#8220;someone said the world’s a stage&#8221;. Yes, that was him too, from <cite>As You Like It</cite>.

In honour of the Bard and his influence on popular culture, here are some popular works that owe a debt to the Bard.

## [<cite>The Lion King</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/413747?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(9673562)&QRYTEXT=The%20lion%20king%20%5Bvideorecording%5D)

[![The Lion King](/images/article/the-lion-king.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/413747?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(9673562)&QRYTEXT=The%20lion%20king%20%5Bvideorecording%5D)

<cite>The Lion King</cite> has marked similarities with Shakespeare&#8217;s <cite>Hamlet</cite>. Simba&#8217;s uncle Scar kills Mufasa to become King, then a grown-up Simba seeks vengeance on Scar, after seeing a vision of his father&#8217;s ghost, of course. And don&#8217;t forget the comical Rosencrantz and Guildenstern-esque Timon and Pumbaa.

## [<cite>10 things I hate about you</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/414407?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(1983765)&QRYTEXT=10%20things%20I%20hate%20about%20you)

[![10 things I hate about you](/images/article/10-things-i-hate-about-you.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/414407?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(1983765)&QRYTEXT=10%20things%20I%20hate%20about%20you)

Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) can’t date Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) until her shrewish older sister Katherina (Julia Stiles) dates, so they set her up with bad boy Patrick (Heath Ledger). Bianca is Bianca, Katherina is Katherina, Patrick is Petruchio, and Cameron is Lucentio — Cameron even disguises himself as a language tutor, just as Lucentio does in <cite>Taming of the Shrew</cite>. I don’t recall Shakespeare writing ‘the s*** hath hitteth the fan’ though...

## [<cite>Something wicked this way comes</cite> by Ray Bradbury](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/414912?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(501432)&QRYTEXT=Something%20wicked%20this%20way%20comes)

Dora and Nora Chance are a famous song-and-dance team of the British music halls. Billed as The Lucky Chances, the sisters are the illegitimate and unacknowledged daughters of Sir Melchoir Hazard, the greatest Shakespearean actor of his day. The book is written in five chapters just as a Shakespearian play often had five acts.

## [<cite>Me and Orson Welles</cite> by Robert Kaplow](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/416868?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(597776)&QRYTEXT=Me%20and%20Orson%20Welles)

King Leontes – whose accusations of adultery against his wife, Hermione, and Polixenes, his childhood friend, galvanise the action in <cite>The Winter’s Tale</cite> – becomes Leo, a hedge fund manager who uses money and status to bludgeon his way through the world. This is the first commission in a series of top writers &#8211; Margaret Atwood, Anne Tyler and Howard Jacobson, reimagining Shakespeare’s plays for the 21st Century.

[![Sigh no more by Mumford and Sons](/images/article/sigh-no-more.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/422653?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(15007170)&QRYTEXT=Sigh%20no%20more%20%5Bsound%20recording%5D)

<cite>Sigh No More</cite> is the first song on the album; the line is from <cite>Much Ado About Nothing</cite>. There are also quotes from Macbeth, such as &#8220;Stars hide your fires&#8221;.

## [<cite>Gnomeo and Juliet</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/424262?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(5512100)&QRYTEXT=Gnomeo%20and%20Juliet)

Perhaps not one for the purists. Shakespeare&#8217;s story of doomed love is transposed to the world of the suburban front lawn as lovestruck garden gnomes Gnomeo (voiced by James McAvoy) and Juliet (Emily Blunt) find themselves caught up in a feud between the next-door neighbours to whom they belong. Can they find a way to be together despite the many everyday garden obstacles that stand in their way?

## [<cite>Exit Music (For A Film)</cite> from <cite>OK Computer</cite> by Radiohead](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/425140?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(1964967)&QRYTEXT=OK%20computer)

This song was originally written to play over the end credits of Baz Luhrmann’s 1996 <cite>Romeo and Juliet</cite> (although it didn’t make it onto the soundtrack), but Thom Yorke says it was also inspired by Shakespeare’s play itself and Zeffirelli’s 1960s <cite>Romeo And Juliet</cite> film.

## [<cite>A thousand acres</cite> by Jane Smiley](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/426491?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(114121)&QRYTEXT=A%20thousand%20acres)

When Larry Cook, the ageing patriarch of a rich, thriving farm in Iowa, decides to retire, he offers his land to his three daughters. For Ginny and Rose, who live on the farm with their husbands, the gift makes sense &#8211; a reward for years of hard work, a challenge to make the farm even more successful. But the youngest, Caroline, a Des Moines lawyer, flatly rejects the idea, and in anger her father cuts her out, setting off an explosive series of events that will leave none of them unchanged. <cite>King Lear</cite>, anyone?
