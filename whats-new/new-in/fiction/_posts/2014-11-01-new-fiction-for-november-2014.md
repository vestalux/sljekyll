Growing up in the west of Ireland in the 1940s Tess is a shy introverted child. Beneath her quiet exterior lies a heart of fire that that will drive her to make her home among the hurly burly of 1960s New York. Over four decades and a life lived with quiet intensity on Academy Street in upper Manhattan, Tess encounters ferocious love and calamitous loss. Joyous and heart-breaking, restrained but sweeping, this is a profoundly moving story that charts one woman&#8217;s quest for belonging amid the dazzle and tumult of America&#8217;s greatest city.
