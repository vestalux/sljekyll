<p>Banker Gabriel is given only months to live after doctors discover a tumour on his brain. But something strange is happening: the position of the tumour is changing Gabriel's personality. He's becoming less selfish, less mercenary, less unlikeable. But it's a catch-22. The kinder and nicer Gabriel becomes, and the more people get to know the new, nicer version of him, the closer he draws to the inevitable.</p>
