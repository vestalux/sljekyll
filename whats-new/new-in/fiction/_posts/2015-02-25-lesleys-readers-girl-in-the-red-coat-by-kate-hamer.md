## Maddie Smith&#8217;s review:

Having to acknowledge the abduction of your child will remain for most parents no more than a latent fear, but it also a fear that threatens to be catastrophic if it is awakened. This is the premise to Kate Hamer’s debut novel, <cite>The Girl in the Red Coat</cite>, which tells the chilling story of the abduction of 8 year old Carmel Wakeford and the suffering her mother, Beth, endures in the wake of her disappearance.

Set in rural Norfolk, Carmel and Beth lead a stable family life, despite Beth being separated from Carmel’s father, Paul. Carmel is acknowledged by those who surround her as a daydreamer and a maverick; she sparks attention with family friends and her teachers as a girl who holds an air of mystery and is indisputably clever for her age.

Hamer creates with Carmel a hauntingly real depiction of a child tentatively approaching her teenage years – she is endearing in her naïve apprehension of the world around her, yet also keen to learn upon her experiences to build a better picture of what she can ascertain as fact.

It is the naivety and innocence of Carmel that lends itself towards her abduction. In a single moment of distraction Carmel is separated from her mother at a village festival and the two are unable to find one another.

Enter a mysterious man who spots Carmel and presents himself to her as her long-lost grandfather. The man tells Carmel they must leave the fair together, and trusting Carmel departs with him obediently. Her abduction now sets the stage for a spiralling series of thrilling, perverse and haunting events over the next five years.

It is a fantastic decision by Hamer to have the story oscillate between Carmel and Beth’s point of view. I felt this style of narration really brought the novel to life, as it creates an immersive experience in which the reader can understand the abduction from two very contrasting perspectives.

It becomes clear that while Carmel grows in her experiences during her abduction, Beth regresses, continuing each day further into a state of depression.

Framing her novel over the series of days Carmel has been missing for made me think of other bestselling crime-fiction such as Gillian Flynn’s <cite><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/13075262?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(185983)&QRYTEXT=Gone%20girl">Gone Girl</a></cite>, where in both cases the ‘days missing’ format reiterates the passing of time and creates an increasing sense of desperation.

I was also reminded of the fantastic Ian McEwan whose novel <cite><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/13074538?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(559738)&QRYTEXT=The%20child%20in%20time">The Child in Time</a></cite> is also based around a parent’s coming-to-terms with the abduction of their child. For those who like crime fiction, <cite>The Girl in the Red Coat</cite> is not one that should be missed on any count.

My only slight criticism would be the book’s ending, which I felt was resolved too quickly for what its long series of events really needed. After being confronted with a dazzling mystery I was ready for a thorough unravelling to greet me at the novel’s end, but this was all tied off too quickly and neatly for my liking.

That aside, <cite>The Girl in the Red Coat</cite> is a beautifully written story that conveys the people and situations at the heart of a terrible event with sensitivity and realism. With a heaping of mystery, crime and drama this is an exciting debut novel by the newest writer to join the prestigious line of Faber & Faber authors. I’m eagerly anticipating the next novel from Kate Hamer!

## Lesley Dolphin&#8217;s review:

A gripping read. This is cleverly told — the story alternates between the mum and the daughter and it’s told by them so we feel the absolute desperation of a mother who’s child is lost and the confusion of the little girl who’s taken. I couldn’t put it down — everything had to wait until I’d got to the end to see if it has a happy ending. Obviously I’m not going to tell you, but it’s left me wanting to know more, which means everyone will be talking about <cite>The Girl In The Red Coat</cite>!
