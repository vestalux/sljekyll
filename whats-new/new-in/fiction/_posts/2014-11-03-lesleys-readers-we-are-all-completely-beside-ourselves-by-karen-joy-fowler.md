## Sarah Jenkins&#8217; review:

You know something is amiss when you are part of the way through this book. You realise that the sisterly bond between the narrator, Rosemary, and her sibling Fern is somehow unusual. It is a credit to the author that you do not realise what this unusual thing is much before the revelation itself, about a third of the way through the book &#8211; unless you have seen the spoilers that abound on the internet.

It is almost impossible to review this book without giving away the revelation but I will try. The book is a scientific experiment that tugs at the heart strings and makes the reader analyse just what it is to be human &#8211; or not, as the case may be!

In truth the subject matter is strange but somehow totally believable. I did enjoy reading this book &#8211; it is refreshingly different and makes you think. The narrative darts backwards and forwards, which seems to be a popular device with authors at present, but it works in this case and is necessary in order for the story to unfold.

I really didn’t like Karen Joy Fowler’s first novel, <cite>The Jane Austen Book Club</cite>, which was made into a film, but this book is on another level completely. The subject matter is not entirely science fiction either, as anyone who has watched the true life 2012 film about Nim Chimpsky will know. This makes this read all the more moving.

You must add this book to your &#8216;books to read&#8217; list.
