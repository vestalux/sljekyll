Springtime, and two misfits – one an eccentric loner and the other a one-eyed dog – forge an unlikely relationship. In a tired seaside town, these outcasts find solace in each other. But as their friendship grows, they are driven away by a community that perceives menace where there is only mishap.

Yuri Herrera explores the crossings and translations people make in their minds and language as they move from one country to another, especially when there’s no going back. Traversing this lonely territory is Makina; leaving behind her life in Mexico to search for her brother, she is smuggled into the USA carrying a pair of secret messages – one from her mother and one from the Mexican underworld.

How did the girl who once dreamed of being a Charlie's Angel become such a cowed and submissive woman? Marion's life appears perfectly fine but she is controlled and bullied by her husband, her only respite a once a week trip to the local swimming pool. A chance meeting with an old school-friend develops into a secret relationship. She could leave her abusive and unfaithful husband. But is it too late?

[![The Illusion of Separateness by Simon Van Booy](/images/article/the-illusion-of-separateness.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/13677393?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(22123678)&amp;QRYTEXT=The%20illusion%20of%20separateness)

The story of how one man’s act of mercy on a World War II battlefield changes the lives of six strangers across time and place, including a child on the brink of starvation, a blind museum curator looking for love, a German infantryman, and a humble caretaker at a retirement home in Santa Monica. These characters remain unaware of their connection until seemingly random acts of selflessness reveal the vital parts they play in each other’s lives. Inspired by true events.
