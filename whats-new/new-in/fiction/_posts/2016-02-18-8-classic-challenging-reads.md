Fitzgerald himself called his 1925 portrait of the Jazz Age and story of obsessive love a &#8220;consciously artistic achievement&#8221; and a &#8220;purely creative work.&#8221; It offers complicated characters who can be interpreted in fresh ways by new readers. It is also beautifully written.

A novel of stupefying ambition. Five sections with different characters and settings, all linked to a Mexican city where 300 young women have been murdered. It’s based on the real town of Ciudad Juarez, where thousands of women have been murdered or gone missing in the past 20 years. This is Bolano’s masterpiece.

## [<cite>Oblomov</cite> by Ivan Goncharov](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/1258105?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(67168)&QRYTEXT=Oblomov)

[![Oblomov by Ivan Goncharov](/images/article/oblomov.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/1258105?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(67168)&QRYTEXT=Oblomov)

The novel focuses on the midlife crisis of the main character, Ilya Ilyich Oblomov, an upper middle class son of a member of Russia&#8217;s nineteenth century landed gentry. While comedic, the novel also seriously examines many critical issues that faced Russian society in the nineteenth century. Some of these problems included the uselessness of landowners and gentry in a feudal society that did not encourage innovation or reform. This is beautifully written and has a lot to say about the human condition.
