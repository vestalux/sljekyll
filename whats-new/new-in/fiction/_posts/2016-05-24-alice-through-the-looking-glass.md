<p class="mt0">The author, an Oxford don, draws on previously unpublished material.</p>

<p>This work illuminates the tangled history of two lives and two books, examining the peculiar friendship between Oxford mathematician Charles Dodgson, Lewis Carroll, and Alice Liddell, the child for whom he invented the Alice stories. It analyses how their relationship influenced the creation of Wonderland, how the two Alice books took on an unstoppable cultural momentum in the Victorian era, and why 150 years later they continue to enthrall and delight us.</p>

<p><cite>The story of Alice</cite> was shortlisted for the Costa Biography Award in 2015.</p>

<p class="mt0">Best known today as the illustrator of Lewis Carroll's Alice books, John Tenniel was one of the Victorian era's chief political cartoonists.</p>

<p>This book is the first to draw on primary sources in family collections, public archives, and other depositories. There are six chapters on Tenniel's work for Carroll. These reveal links with Christmas pantomimes, Punch and Judy shows, nursery toys, magic lanterns, nineteenth-century grotesques, Gothic revivalism, and social caricatures.</p>

<p class="mt0">The 1951 Disney cartoon is often an introduction to Alice for children. In this animated Disney version of Lewis Carroll's stories, young Alice (voiced by Kathryn Beaumont) is transported to Wonderland after being distracted by the White Rabbit, who is late for a very important date. There she encounters the grinning Cheshire Cat (Sterling Holloway), joins the Mad Hatter's (Ed Wynn) tea party, and falls foul of the ill-tempered Queen of Hearts (Verna Felton) during a game of croquet.</p>
