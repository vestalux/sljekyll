## Sarah Jenkins&#8217; review:

The story starts in the heat of West Bombay, two decades before it became Mumbai. Hassan Haji is the second of six children and grows up surrounded by the intense smells and tastes of Indian cuisine in his family’s restaurants. After a family tragedy, they move to London where Hassan grows up and his teenage years are beautifully and sometimes humorously depicted. The next move for the family is to France and the village of Lumiere. There, Hassan is discovered by Madame Mallory who realises, to her horror, that he is a naturally talented chef who is destined for greatness.

The author is brilliant at creating truly quirky characters such as Hassan’s papa and the other ragtag of rural inhabitants of Lumiere. The contrast between Madame Mallory’s high end, award winning but staid restaurant Le Saule Pleureur and papa’s florescent loud Indian restaurant is written without the author resorting to hyperbole. Hussan is not a totally likeable character but then nor is Madame Mallory, however it is their human frailties that make them interesting and keep you reading.

If you enjoy an intelligent read with a fast paced narrative and you want to feed your senses with the sights, tastes and smells of wonderful cuisine, then this is the book for you. I loved it.
