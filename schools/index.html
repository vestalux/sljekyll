  <p class="mt2">The Literacy, Books and Reading Team for Schools offers specialist knowledge and experience to support leisure and curriculum reading in schools across all sectors.</p>

  <p class="mt2">Our services include resources, advice and guidance, training and special events. Our 'menu' system provides value, choice and flexibility as you can pick exactly what your school requires.</p>

  <p class="mt2">For many of our services, we offer 'supported' loans, where we provide, select and deliver books to your school, and 'self-service' loans, where your school is issued with a library card you can use at any Suffolk Library. We offer annual rolling contracts and pay-as-you-go services.</p>
