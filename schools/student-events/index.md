## Book Mastermind

A county-wide competition that is open to all students in Years 7-9. A great way to promote reading within your school.  
There are 30 schools who regularly enter this quiz that is based on ‘Mastermind’ with the specialist subject being a book of the student’s choice.
The competition starts in the Autumn term with winners from each school competing in area finals during March.  The county final is held in May and includes workshops by leading authors for young people.  The winning school keeps the BMM trophy for a year and receives £200 worth of books.
An information pack is available and this explains how to run the Book Mastermind competition in your school.  Please contact Maxine Williams if you would like one: Maxine.williams@suffolklibraries.co.uk


## Book Cafes

Our pop-up Book Cafes have become a popular way of sharing a love of books and reading with pupils, staff and parents of Primary Schools.  
We bring an enticing selection of books to your school and loan one book to each child attending, encouraging them to share with their parents and carers.  
We offer soft drinks, leaflets, publishers’ promotional items, guidance and advice.  We love to theme these events and can include storytelling too.  
Cafes can be held at a time to suit your school and with a chosen age group if preferred.  Just provide us with space, tables and time to set up in advance.  
The cost is £195 per café or is free if your school spends more than £2,000 with LBaRT in the same financial year.
