## Book Mastermind

There are 30 schools who regularly enter this county-wide quiz based on <cite>Mastermind</cite>. It is open to all students in years 7-9, and the specialist subject is a book of the student’s choice. It is a great way to promote reading within your school.

The competition starts in the autumn term, with winners from each school competing in area finals during March. The county final is held in May and includes workshops by leading authors for young people.

The winning school keeps the Book Mastermind trophy for a year and receives £200 worth of books.

Please email **Maxine.williams@suffolklibraries.co.uk** if you would like an information pack.

## Book Cafés

At our popular pop-up Book Cafés, we share a love of books and reading with pupils, staff and parents in primary schools.

We bring an enticing selection of books to your school and loan one book to each child attending, encouraging them to share with their parents and carers. We also offer soft drinks, leaflets, publishers’ promotional items, guidance and advice.

Cafés can be held at a time to suit your school and with a chosen age group if preferred. Just provide us with space, tables and time to set up in advance. We love to theme these events and can include storytelling too.

The cost is £195 per café or is free if your school spends more than £2,000 with LBaRT in the same financial year. For more information, [contact us →](/schools/contact/).
