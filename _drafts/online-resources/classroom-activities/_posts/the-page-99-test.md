There are many ways to select your next book. Suffolk Libraries publishes [fantastic monthly lists of the best new books](/new-suggestions/), the website Goodreads is a great online tool, [ranking books by reader reviews](http://www.goodreads.com/list/popular_lists) and there are even online [book generators](http://summerreadingchallenge.org.uk/book-sorter) to help you decide.

One of my favourite ways is to browse the library shelves until I find something that catches my eye. Once the book is in my hand I can look at the cover, scan the blurb and maybe read the first couple of pages. But what about if you are still not sure that this is the book for you? Well, you could try the page 99 test.

The page 99 test is a method of evaluating a work of fiction suggested by literary critic [Ford Madox Ford](http://www.fordmadoxfordsociety.org/fords-biography.html). He said, “Open the book to page ninety-nine and read, and the quality of the whole will be revealed to you.” Apparently, sneaky editors and book publishers spend more time and effort polishing the early pages of a book to grab your attention from the start. By looking at page 99 you can make a better judgement about the quality of the writing.

I gave this a go with a few books from our [Ipswich branch](/branches/ipswich-county-library). Click on an image to enlarge it<figure>

What do you think? Has page 99 got you interested in the story? Do you want to find out what has happened previously?

**Activity**

I think it could be a useful way to get young people to try different genres of books. One person reads page 99 out to someone without telling them the author or title. Does the listener like the sound of it? If they do they could borrow it and start reading (from page 1!). If not, move on to the next book until they find something they like.

**Note:** For quick reads or novellas you could turn to about a third of the way into the book. Also, it&#8217;s a bit pot luck as to what page 99 can contain &#8211; if it&#8217;s blank or an image then look at the next pages.

If any of the page 99s above have piqued your interest, you can find out what they are below:
