Since starting this role back in October 2015, I have met so many wonderful groups, projects, organisations and people, all doing fantastic things for Mental Health and Wellbeing across Suffolk.

I wanted to find a way of sharing these with you and to encourage you all to get to know what&#8217;s happening in your local area. So, here is a fun new feature &#8216;All About&#8230;&#8217; in which organisations and projects can complete a short interview for our Mental health and Wellbeing blog.

If you belong to an organisation or project and would like to be featured, or you would like us to feature something specific, please do get in touch using our contact form.

Watch this space!
