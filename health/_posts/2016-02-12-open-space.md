Open Space has been running weekly in Ipswich County Library for almost a year now, and since it is so successful we thought we would start to share some of what we do with you!

First off, to introduce you, Open Space is a relaxed group where you can meet new people, have a chat, make new friends, or just listen in with word puzzles and colouring if you would prefer! The group is supported through a partnership between Suffolk Libraries, [Julian Support](http://www.juliansupport.org/) and the [Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust](http://www.nsft.nhs.uk/Pages/Home.aspx). It&#8217;s free to attend, you are welcome to come and go as you please, and there is a free cuppa and a biscuit too.

We have a timetable of discussion topics which are great if you are interested in having a friendly chat about wellbeing, or you can just sit and chat about your day if you would prefer — there is no pressure to take part. Sometimes the group also take walks or trips (something which we are hoping to do more of in the future!) and sometimes we take part in activities in the library, such as arts and crafts.

If you are interested in attending, please do just come along and see us — the group is every Wednesday, 1pm-3pm, or feel free to call me on 01473 263819 if you have any questions.

To give you an idea of the sorts of things we talk about, our timetable is below. We hope to see you there soon!
