For Anti Bullying Week, we've put together a list of recommendations for children and young adults on the subject of bullying.

Bullying can be frightening and isolating, so we hope that these titles help young people who are being bullied to feel less alone, and seek help. Even if they're not being bullied, it's important for children to understand how it feels to be in such a situation and learn what to do if they experience or witness bullying.

<h3>Benedict Blathwayt - <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/20717389?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(10547206)&QRYTEXT=Dinosaur%20chase!"><cite>Dinosaur Chase!</cite></a></h3>

Fin is a dinosaur unlike any other - teased for his 'spindly little legs, bony tale and feeble fluffy arms'. Despite his odd appearance, when a gang of four big, bullying dinosaurs chase him into the woods, Fin manages to outwit three of them. But can he beat the meanest and fiercest dinosaur of them all?

<h3>Anthony Browne - <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?ENTRY=willy+the+wimp&ENTRY_NAME=BS&ENTRY_TYPE=K&SEARCH_FORM=%2Fcgi-bin%2Fspydus.exe%2FMSGTRN%2FOPAC%2FBSEARCH%3FHOMEPRMS%3DBSEARCHPARAMS&SORTS=SQL_REL_TITLE&ISGLB=0&GQ=willy+the+wimp"><cite>Willy the Wimp</cite></a></h3>

30 years after its publication, this book is as fresh and relevant as ever. Timid gorilla Willy wouldn't hurt a fly - he even apologises when someone hits him. The suburban gorillas call him Willy the Wimp. Then, one day, Willy answers a bodybuilding advertisement - with hilarious results!

<h3>John Burningham - <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?ENTRY=avocado+baby&ENTRY_NAME=BS&ENTRY_TYPE=K&SEARCH_FORM=%2Fcgi-bin%2Fspydus.exe%2FMSGTRN%2FOPAC%2FBSEARCH%3FHOMEPRMS%3DBSEARCHPARAMS&SORTS=SQL_REL_TITLE&ISGLB=0&GQ=avocado+baby"><cite>Avocado Baby</cite></a></h3>

Something Else is a small creature who does his best to join in with the others. But he's different. No matter how he tries, he just doesn't belong.

Then Something turns up and wants to be friends. But Something Else isn't sure he's like him at all.

A story about exclusion, the most common form of bullying amongst young children, this book deals with difference and the power of friendship. It’s lovely to read, well resolved and an excellent choice.

Isn't there any way to make playtime fun for everyone?

<cite>Rex Wrecks It!</cite> is well illustrated, jolly and great for conversations about respecting personal space.
