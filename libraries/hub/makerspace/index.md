		<p>KANO is a DIY computer kit designed to help people of all ages assemble a computer from scratch and learn basic coding skills. Preloaded with software and a child-friendly interface, accompanied by a keyboard built for coding and gaming, and all powered of Raspberry Pi - the credit-card-sized computer aimed at kids.</p>

		<p>Our KANO kits include everything required to build a computer including a Raspberry Pi, a case, wireless keyboard with trackpad, cables, Wi-Fi dongle, and even a speaker. The simple instructional guide shows users how to build the computer by connecting all of the parts together and plugging it into one of our HDMI monitors.</p>

		<p>The kit’s coding component is Kano OS, an open source visual programming language that can output code in Javascript and Python among other languages.
