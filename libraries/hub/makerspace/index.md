		<p>KANO is a DIY computer kit designed to help people of all ages assemble a computer from scratch and learn basic coding skills. Preloaded with software and a child-friendly interface, accompanied by a keyboard built for coding and gaming, and all powered of Raspberry Pi - the credit-card-sized computer aimed at kids.</p>

		<p>Our KANO kits include everything required to build a computer including a Raspberry Pi, a case, wireless keyboard with trackpad, cables, Wi-Fi dongle, and even a speaker. The simple instructional guide shows users how to build the computer by connecting all of the parts together and plugging it into one of our HDMI monitors.</p>

		<p>The kit’s coding component is Kano OS, an open source visual programming language that can output code in Javascript and Python among other languages. On Kano OS users can perform activities like making music, streaming HD video, reprogramming games like Pong and Minecraft, composing music, work processing and web browsing.</p>
