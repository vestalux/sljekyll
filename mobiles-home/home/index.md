If health or mobility issues are preventing you getting to a branch or mobile library, volunteers from Suffolk Libraries home library service may be able to help.

The service is free and available from most libraries.

Volunteers will visit you in your own home, help you decide which books will interest you and order books from the library for you. They will collect the books from the library and deliver them to your door.
 
If you would like to receive this service, please [contact your local library](/libraries/) or email **hls@suffolklibraries.co.uk**.

# Volunteering

Our volunteers work with library staff to regularly visit customers, providing social interaction and delivering library stock.

The minimum volunteers contribute is a morning or afternoon each month. They need access to a car, driving themselves or pairing up with another volunteer.
