The Summer Reading Challenge depends on the efforts of hundreds of volunteers across our libraries.

## What do summer reading volunteers do?

Summer reading volunteers:

* Help sign children up to the challenge in libraries
* Explain how the challenge works
* Talk to children about the books they have ready
* Hand out rewards and incentives.

## Who are Summer Reading Challenge volunteers?

We're looking for volunteers:

* Of all ages over 13
* Who can ideally commit 2-8 hours per week for a minimum of six weeks over the summer holidays - if you can't manage this but would still like to help, please speak to [your local library](/libraries/) about other opportunities.

## What are the benefits of volunteering for the SRC?

Summer reading challenge volunteers:

* Really make a difference to children's reading and literacy skills
* Gain experience of working with children
* Can put their volunteering hours towards the [Duke of Edinburgh award](http://www.dofe.org/), [Arts Award](http://www.artsaward.org.uk/) and [Reading Hack](http://readinghack.org.uk/) incentives.
* In 2015, 82% of Summer Reading Challenge volunteers nationwide felt that their skills had increased, and 78% felt like part of their community as a result of taking part
* In 2014, the Summer Reading Challenge was found to increase volunteers' sense of purpose, autonomy, happiness, self-esteem, motivation at school and future employment chances

To get involved, contact [your local library](/libraries/) or apply online with our [Summer Reading Challenge volunteering form](/events-activities/summer-reading-challenge/summer-reading-challenge-volunteer-application-form/).
