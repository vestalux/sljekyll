If you haven’t had a look at [our new digital magazine service](https://www.rbdigital.com/Suffolk/service/zinio/landing) you really must. We have such a great collection of magazines available and the best bit is, they are free and you can keep them forever.

Whenever I tell people this, they can’t quite believe it — so much so that I sometimes doubt it myself. But yes, they definitely are free and I’ve got an iPad full various titles to prove it.

We’ve launched the service with a selection of 34 top name magazines covering titles from [BBC History](https://www.rbdigital.com/Suffolk/service/zinio/landing?mag_id=1314) to [Marie Clare](https://www.rbdigital.com/Suffolk/service/zinio/landing?mag_id=880) and [Top Gear Magazine](https://www.rbdigital.com/Suffolk/service/zinio/landing?mag_id=3024) to the [New Scientist](https://www.rbdigital.com/Suffolk/service/zinio/landing?mag_id=6896). Every single one seems to have been a hit with customers (the only exception being the golf magazine!). Clearly our stock librarian Brandon made a good initial selection.

All you need is a library card number and a device to read your magazine on, such as your PC or laptop at home, or a smartphone or tablet on the move. Once the magazine has been downloaded you can read it offline so it’s perfect for when you’re out and about (unless you’ve only got a PC which might be a bit cumbersome to carry around).

The Christmas issues are all coming out this month. Perfect for discovering new recipes in [BBC Good Food](https://www.rbdigital.com/Suffolk/service/zinio/landing?mag_id=441), getting Christmas inspiration from [Good Housekeeping](https://www.rbdigital.com/Suffolk/service/zinio/landing?mag_id=744) or finding something special to make for Christmas gifts in [Knit Today](https://www.rbdigital.com/Suffolk/service/zinio/landing?mag_id=6559) and [Cross Stitch Crazy](https://www.rbdigital.com/Suffolk/service/zinio/landing?mag_id=6556).
