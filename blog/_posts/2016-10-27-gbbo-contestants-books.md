<h2>As a nation, over the past ten weeks, we’ve become very attached to this year’s <cite>Great British Bake Off</cite> contestants. We won’t forget Paul Hollywood eating Val’s (gingerbread) sister, Selasi’s extremely chilled demeanour, or Mel reapplying Candice’s lipstick for her.</h2>

In fact, it could be argued that <cite>Bake Off</cite> contestants have particular staying power compared to stars of other TV competitions, as they often go on to produce quality recipe books that can be used again and again. One previous winner’s book has been issued from Suffolk Libraries an astounding 600 times! If you’ve caught the baking bug, try some of these <cite>Bake Off</cite> stars’ books.

The surprise winner of the 2012 series has published three books to date. <cite>John Whaite Bakes</cite> categorises recipes according to mood, making it easier to decide which recipe to try.

<h2>Howard Middleton (2013 runner-up) - <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?ENTRY_NAME=TI&ENTRY=&ENTRY1_OPER=%2B&ENTRY2_NAME=AU&ENTRY2=howard+middleton&ENTRY2_TYPE=K&ENTRY3_NAME=SU&ENTRY3=&ENTRY_TYPE=K&ENTRY3_OPER=%2B&NRECS=20&SORTS=HBT.SOVR&SEARCH_FORM=%2Fcgi-bin%2Fspydus.exe%2FMSGTRN%2FOPAC%2FBSEARCH&CF=GEN&ISGLB=0&GQ="><cite>Delicious Gluten-free Baking: sweet and savoury recipes for everyone to enjoy</cite></a></h2>

Nadiya has certainly been busy since winning last year’s competition! <cite>Nadiya’s Kitchen</cite> categorises recipes according to time of day and occasion, such as ‘lazy Sunday mornings’, ‘midnight feasts’ and ‘snacks and sharing’. It features a huge range of recipes, from full English frittata to kofta kebab to meat samosas.

We’ve already raved about <cite>Nadiya’s Bake Me A Story</cite> on our <cite>Bake Off</cite>-inspired blog post about [baking books for children](https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/blog/bake-off-books/) and our [new children’s books for October 2016](https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/new-suggestions/childrens-ya-books/new-childrens-books-for-october-2016/) list, but we just think it’s such an original idea to combine recipes with stories and the book is visually stunning. Make gingerbread men, very-berry muffins, bean patties and more.
