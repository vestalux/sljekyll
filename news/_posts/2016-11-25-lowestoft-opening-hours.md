[Lowestoft Library](/libraries/lowestoft-library) will be closing earlier for the next 12 weeks due to ongoing issues with anti-social behaviour.

From Thursday 1 December 2016 to Thursday 23 February 2017 the library will be closing at 5pm from Monday to Friday. The library is normally open until 6pm on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays and until 7pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The library closes at 5pm on Saturday and 4pm on Sunday so these days are not affected.

The temporary early closure has been agreed following incidents of anti-social behaviour which seem to become worse during the colder weather and darker evenings. The early closure has been agreed after a similar measure helped reduce the problem last year.

Suffolk Libraries apologises to any customers affected by the early closure but this action is being taken with the wellbeing of customers and staff in mind.

Suffolk Libraries are working with Suffolk Police and other agencies on an ongoing basis to tackle the issues.   Anyone witnessing anti-social behaviour at the library is encouraged to report it to staff or the police.
