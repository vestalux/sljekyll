We're designing a new self-service system to replace our current set up, which we installed eight years ago.

To help us provide the best possible design we need you to help us test our new system.

## What the testing involves

We'll be able to do most of our tests online over the internet. We'd simply send you a link with a few instructions which you can complete without anyone from the library present.

We will also need to complete some tests here in the library. You can choose whether to just do online tests, tests in the library or a combination. Most testing will take place at [Ipswich County Library](/libraries/ipswich-county-library/), although we may able to travel to [a library nearer to you](/libraries/).

## Waterstones vouchers

As a thank you we'll give you a free DVD Premier loan (normal value &pound;3). We'll also enter you into a prize drawer for one of six &pound;10 Waterstones vouchers.

## How to sign up

**Email leon.paternoster@suffolklibraries.co.uk, indicating whether you're interested in online testing and/or testing in a library.**
