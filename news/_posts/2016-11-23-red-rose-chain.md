Suffolk Libraries have recently teamed up with local theatre company Red Rose Chain for a unique and exciting project to make a short film, looking at the relationship young people have with their local library and how their library can support their wellbeing.

We worked with a small group of wonderful young people who regularly use Gainsborough library, and asked them to give us a tour of the space whilst chatting, filming and taking pictures. The group then developed concepts for animating and worked together with Red Rose Chain to design and shoot each section. The result is a fantastic, colourful, fun and honest look at the way our libraries can support young people and their wellbeing.

Our Mental Health and Wellbeing coordinator, Sarah Lungley, said "Suffolk’s Libraries do great things for young people across Suffolk every day, and we wanted to do something to capture just how important a library can be to supporting good wellbeing and creating a resilient community.

"Wellbeing is ingrained in everything we do here, whether that is books, signposting for services, groups and events or just somewhere safe and warm to be and we will continue to develop and innovate the way we work with young people to ensure we are providing the best service possible. We are very excited to share this animated video with you and hope you enjoy it."

If you are a young person and feel that your library helps your wellbeing, or if you are an adult who has used their local library in the past, we’d love to hear from you.
