title: What we filter on public PCs and our WiFi service

As a library service we believe in freedom of speech. We only block access to internet sites or pages you access on our fixed PCs if a website:

* publishes illegal material
* publishes material of a racist or homophobic nature
* publishes material we deem pornographic or excessively violent

We do reserve the right to block any website we choose.

Our internet access is filtered by third parties; however, we can ask for a site or page to be unblocked when you access it from one of our fixed PCs.

We can&#8217;t unblock sites you access via our WiFi service. The filtering on the WiFi service is set nationally by the WiFi provider (either Polkaspots or O2). We&#8217;ve chosen ‘family’ WiFi filtering levels because we can&#8217;t tell who&#8217;s using the service.

If you feel we&#8217;re blocking a website we shouldn&#8217;t, contact us at **help@suffolklibraries.co.uk**
