Our library opening hours vary from library to library.

**[Find a library and its opening times](/libraries/)**.

We close for [all UK public holidays](https://www.gov.uk/bank-holidays), including Good Friday and Easter Sunday.

We also close for one extra day over Christmas, normally Christmas Eve.
