## Renewing books, CDs and DVDs

[Login to your account](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/MSGTRN/OPAC/LOGINB) to renew books online. You can also call 01473 263838 (available 24/7 with an out-of-hours answering service) or visit any Suffolk library.

You can **renew a book up to six times** unless it is reserved by someone else.

Any overdue charges or new hire charges (eg for DVDs) will be logged to your account up to a given **credit limit**, for payment when you are next in the library.
