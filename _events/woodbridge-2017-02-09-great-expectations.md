James Hornsby presents one of Charles Dickens' best loved novels. Performed once again as a ‘one-man’ play, James will bring to life a host of wonderful characters including Magwitch, The Gargerys, Uncle Pumblechook, Estella, Herbert Pocket, Miss Havisham and, of course, Pip. All presented in the 'inimitable' style of Dickens' own legendary public readings.

Trained at LAMDA, James has a professional acting career that spans more than 30 years and over 150 theatrical productions.

Ticket price includes an interval drink.
