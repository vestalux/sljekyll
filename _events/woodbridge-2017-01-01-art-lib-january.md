This month there will be an exhibition of paintings by Rosario Zinna. Rosario is Italian by birth and British by naturalisation. Having obtained a medical degree in Naples he married an English lady and moved to England. He has worked in Canada, the United States and in England in the NHS, retiring some 30 years ago.

Rosario has always been keen to practice crafts, particularly drawing, and hopes that you will enjoy looking at what he has produced. Rosario describes his work as “pencil paintings” and strives to show contrast and light and dark in his work.
