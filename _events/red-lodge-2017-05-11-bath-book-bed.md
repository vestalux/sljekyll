Suffolk Libraries Local Red Lodge is supporting a campaign by the charity BookTrust which aims to help children (and parents) get a good night’s sleep!

Parents and carers attending the singing and stories session on 11 May from can pick up their free copy of the new Bath, Bed, Book booklet and join in with some soothing songs and stories. Little ones (and adults) are also encouraged to bring along their teddies, and can borrow library books after session!
