The young and young-at-heart are transported to a magical world where mischievous mice besiege a battalion of toy soldiers, and an onstage blizzard leads to an enchanted Land of Sweets.

In the New York City Ballet’s famously extravagant staging of Tchaikovsky’s beloved melodies, one of the most complex theatrical staged ballets in the Company's active repertory, George Balanchine’s stunning choreography shines amidst awe-inspiring set pieces, ornate costumes and grand one-of-a-kind visual effects including a Christmas tree that grows to a height of 40 feet.
