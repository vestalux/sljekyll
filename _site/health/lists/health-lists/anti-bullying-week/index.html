            <p>For Anti Bullying Week, we’ve put together a list of recommendations for children and young adults on the subject of bullying.</p>

<p>Bullying can be frightening and isolating, so we hope that these titles help young people who are being bullied to feel less alone, and seek help. Even if they’re not being bullied, it’s important for children to understand how it feels to be in such a situation and learn what to do if they experience or witness bullying.</p>

<h2>Picture books</h2>

<h3>Benedict Blathwayt - <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/20717389?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(10547206)&amp;QRYTEXT=Dinosaur%20chase!"><cite>Dinosaur Chase!</cite></a></h3>

<p>Fin is a dinosaur unlike any other - teased for his ‘spindly little legs, bony tale and feeble fluffy arms’. Despite his odd appearance, when a gang of four big, bullying dinosaurs chase him into the woods, Fin manages to outwit three of them. But can he beat the meanest and fiercest dinosaur of them all?</p>

<h3>Anthony Browne - <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?ENTRY=willy+the+wimp&amp;ENTRY_NAME=BS&amp;ENTRY_TYPE=K&amp;SEARCH_FORM=%2Fcgi-bin%2Fspydus.exe%2FMSGTRN%2FOPAC%2FBSEARCH%3FHOMEPRMS%3DBSEARCHPARAMS&amp;SORTS=SQL_REL_TITLE&amp;ISGLB=0&amp;GQ=willy+the+wimp"><cite>Willy the Wimp</cite></a></h3>

<p>30 years after its publication, this book is as fresh and relevant as ever. Timid gorilla Willy wouldn’t hurt a fly - he even apologises when someone hits him. The suburban gorillas call him Willy the Wimp. Then, one day, Willy answers a bodybuilding advertisement - with hilarious results!</p>

<h3>John Burningham - <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?ENTRY=avocado+baby&amp;ENTRY_NAME=BS&amp;ENTRY_TYPE=K&amp;SEARCH_FORM=%2Fcgi-bin%2Fspydus.exe%2FMSGTRN%2FOPAC%2FBSEARCH%3FHOMEPRMS%3DBSEARCHPARAMS&amp;SORTS=SQL_REL_TITLE&amp;ISGLB=0&amp;GQ=avocado+baby"><cite>Avocado Baby</cite></a></h3>

<p>The Hargraves family are plagued by bullies. However, when their new baby discovers avocado, he develops super strength and endurance and puts the bullies in their place.</p>

<h3>Kathryn Cave - <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?ENTRY=kathryn+cave+something+else&amp;ENTRY_NAME=BS&amp;ENTRY_TYPE=K&amp;SEARCH_FORM=%2Fcgi-bin%2Fspydus.exe%2FMSGTRN%2FOPAC%2FBSEARCH%3FHOMEPRMS%3DBSEARCHPARAMS&amp;SORTS=SQL_REL_TITLE&amp;ISGLB=0&amp;GQ=kathryn+cave+something+else"><cite>Something Else</cite></a></h3>

<p>Something Else is a small creature who does his best to join in with the others. But he’s different. No matter how he tries, he just doesn’t belong.</p>

<p>Then Something turns up and wants to be friends. But Something Else isn’t sure he’s like him at all.</p>

<p>A story about exclusion, the most common form of bullying amongst young children, this book deals with difference and the power of friendship. It’s lovely to read, well resolved and an excellent choice.</p>

<h3>Ben Clanton - <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?ENTRY=rex+wrecks+it&amp;ENTRY_NAME=BS&amp;ENTRY_TYPE=K&amp;SEARCH_FORM=%2Fcgi-bin%2Fspydus.exe%2FMSGTRN%2FOPAC%2FBSEARCH%3FHOMEPRMS%3DBSEARCHPARAMS&amp;SORTS=SQL_REL_TITLE&amp;ISGLB=0&amp;GQ=rex+wrecks+it"><cite>Rex Wrecks It!</cite></a></h3>

<p>Gizmo, Sprinkles and Wild are fed up. Every time they build something with their blocks, Rex wrecks it! Whether it’s an out-of-this-world rocket, a magical heart or the biggest, strongest, most awesomerific castle ever, Rex sends it crashing down with a ‘rawr!’ (and sometimes a sheepish ‘rawry!’). Isn’t there any way to make playtime fun for everyone?</p>

<p><cite>Rex Wrecks It!</cite> is well illustrated, jolly and great for conversations about respecting personal space.</p>

<h3>Jack Foreman - <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?ENTRY=jack+foreman+say+hello&amp;ENTRY_NAME=BS&amp;ENTRY_TYPE=K&amp;SEARCH_FORM=%2Fcgi-bin%2Fspydus.exe%2FMSGTRN%2FOPAC%2FBSEARCH%3FHOMEPRMS%3DBSEARCHPARAMS&amp;SORTS=SQL_REL_TITLE&amp;ISGLB=0&amp;GQ=jack+foreman+say+hello"><cite>Say Hello</cite></a></h3>

<p>Based on the author’s childhood experience, this is the story of a boy who is left out and all alone, while other children play happily.</p>

<p><cite>Say Hello</cite> is a wonderful and moving picture book about being left out and feeling bullied.</p>

<h3>David McKee - <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?ENTRY=elmer+and+the+big+bird&amp;ENTRY_NAME=BS&amp;ENTRY_TYPE=K&amp;SEARCH_FORM=%2Fcgi-bin%2Fspydus.exe%2FMSGTRN%2FOPAC%2FBSEARCH%3FHOMEPRMS%3DBSEARCHPARAMS&amp;SORTS=SQL_REL_TITLE&amp;ISGLB=0&amp;GQ=elmer+and+the+big+bird"><cite>Elmer and the Big Bird</cite></a></h3>

<h3>Michael Rosen and Arthur Robins - <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?ENTRY=little+rabbit+foo+foo&amp;ENTRY_NAME=BS&amp;ENTRY_TYPE=K&amp;SEARCH_FORM=%2Fcgi-bin%2Fspydus.exe%2FMSGTRN%2FOPAC%2FBSEARCH%3FHOMEPRMS%3DBSEARCHPARAMS&amp;SORTS=SQL_REL_TITLE&amp;ISGLB=0&amp;GQ=little+rabbit+foo+foo"><cite>Little Rabbit Foo Foo</cite></a></h3>

<p>He’s wild, he’s wicked, he’s Little Rabbit Foo Foo! The bully-boy bunny likes nothing better than to ride through the forest bopping everyone on the head. Wriggly worms, tigers, no one is safe. But here comes the Good Fairy - and she’s not amused.</p>

<p>Comeuppance is guaranteed in this perfectly hilarious cautionary tale.</p>

<h3>Steve Smallman and Caroline Pedler - <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/20836734?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(10829795)&amp;QRYTEXT=Who%27s%20afraid%20of%20the%20big%20bad%20bunny%3F"><cite>Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Bunny?</cite></a></h3>

<p>It’s Blue Monster’s first day at Monster Academy and Little Green Monster thinks it’s funny to call him names. Fat face, jelly belly, spotty botty. So how come no one else is laughing? Little Green Monster is soon in big trouble. The new student turns out to be the new teacher.</p>

<h3>Jeanne Willis and Tony Ross - <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/20840905?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(11569353)&amp;QRYTEXT=Chicken%20clicking"><cite>Chicken Clicking</cite></a></h3>

<p>One night Chick hopped into the farmer’s house and had a little browse on his computer. Soon she’s bought a funny teapot, a frilly blouse, scooters for the sheep and a car for the cows. She just can’t stop clicking! She meets a friend online and off she goes to meet him (without telling Mum or Dad). But the friend she thought she’d met turns out to be a fox.</p>

<h3>Jeanne Willis and Tony Ross - <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/20842589?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(11967774)&amp;QRYTEXT=Troll%20stinks"><cite>Troll Stinks</cite></a></h3>

<p>Sydney thinks her mum Amy is the best mum in the world - even if she is a bit different. When everyone else kept growing, Amy got to 124cm and then stopped right there. The perfect height, in Sydney’s opinion: big enough to reach the ice cream at the supermarket, small enough to be special. Sydney’s dad died when she was only five, but her memories of him, her mum’s love and the company of her brave big sister Jade means she never feels alone.</p>

<p>But when the family are forced to move house, things get tricky.

When she’s not posting embarrassing pictures of Skye online or experimenting with bizarre clothing, she’s forever taking up new hobbies - and her latest obsession is ballroom dancing! It’s only a matter of time until she waltzes down the street in spandex and sequins - and to make matters worse, Skye’s younger brother is wildly (and irritatingly) enthusiastic about Mum’s new hobby, and about wearing Mum’s sparkly new outfits!</p>

<p>As if this wasn’t horrific enough, Skye’s mum has also enlisted the new neighbour’s son to come and ‘babysit’ when she’s at dance class, and he’s only a year older than Skye! Talk about mortifying in the extreme! At least Skye’s best friend, Aubrey is there to help Skye cope with her family’s madness. They’ve been friends since before they can remember, and nothing will ever change that - right?</p>
