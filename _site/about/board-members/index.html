<h2 id="biographies">Biographies</h2>

<h3 id="tony-brown">Tony Brown</h3>
<p>Tony worked in marketing after graduating from Oxford with a degree in English. He’s worked with brands such as Beecham, Perrier and NatWest.</p>

<p>He moved to Suffolk in 1991 when he was appointed director of Management Education by the University of East Anglia. He subsequently held senior academic and management roles at UEA, including dean of Continuing Education, and Business Development director.</p>

<p>He has led successful bids to national and regional funding bodies, and implemented change management programmes with, among others, Virgin and Norfolk Constabulary.</p>

<h3 id="peter-callaghan">Peter Callaghan</h3>

<p>Peter is a governor at a Brandon primary school and is involved with the school’s literacy and reading programmes. He is interested in developing library activities at a primary level in partnership with the schools’ library service and very keen on investigating the use of new technologies within the library service.</p>

<p>The Friends of Brandon Library have contributed two Chromebooks and a Wi-Fi printer for general use, and these services have proved effective and popular. Peter believes that there is potential for further developments through the use of e-readers linked to the Overdrive system, especially for older and partially sighted people.</p>

<h3 id="sylvia-knights">Sylvia Knights</h3>

<p>Sylvia has volunteered her support for many libraries, as well as her local library in Bungay.</p>

<p>She was appointed an interim board member of the IPS in February 2012 and was recently re-elected as a trustee and secretary to the Friends of Bungay Community Library. She helped the friends group achieve CIO registration.</p>

<p>Sylvia is Bungay deputy town mayor and a trustee of Bungay Town Trust.</p>

<h3 id="jonathan-ogden">Jonathan Ogden</h3>

<p>Jonathan is a Kesgrave town councillor and Explorer scout leader, teaching young adults new skills.</p>

<p>He works for a major retailer and is the trustee to Kesgrave Library’s friends group.</p>

<h3 id="colin-rockall">Colin Rockall</h3>

<p>Colin has been a resident of Lavenham since 2000 and is the current Chairman of Friends of Lavenham Library.</p>

<p>Much of his professional career was spent in local government and during the period between 1985 and 2000 he held the position of District Council Chief Executive – initially with an authority in Surrey and then a council in Somerset.</p>

<p>In 2000, he joined the Audit Commission, followed by a four year period with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) as a Lead Official. In this role, he represented the Department by working to improve ‘failing’ authorities, reporting to Ministers and senior civil servants. When ODPM was disbanded he became, and still is, a self- employed consultant, continuing to work directly to local authorities on performance and improvement issues.</p>

<p>Within Lavenham, Colin undertakes voluntary work, which includes being a Director of the Lavenham Literary Festival since 2009. He is currently Company Secretary.</p>

<h3 id="maureen-garratt-simpson">Maureen Garratt Simpson</h3>

<p>Maureen has been the chair of the Friends of Ipswich County Library for almost two years; she brings great enthusiasm to the role.  She is experienced in media, having worked for the BBC and lectured in Media Studies at New Suffolk College.  In earlier years, Maureen worked for Cambridgeshire libraries and when her children were small, ran some story time sessions in Gainsborough and Ipswich libraries.  As a teacher, she has worked with students of many nationalities and varied ages and has seen at first hand the need for good books that are readily available to aid research and lead to qualifications that enhance a person’s life and self-esteem.  Maureen’s personal interests involve reading and early music.</p>

<p>Maureen would be a great asset to the Board, being able to put the point of view of the larger libraries.  She has taken part in several County Library events, most recently, Multi-Cultural Day.  She has some knowledge of libraries and how they operate and would be able to further her knowledge with the Board.</p>

<h3 id="alison-wheeler">Alison Wheeler</h3>

<p>Alison is general manager of the IPS. As the chief executive officer she is accountable to the board for the day to day management of the IPS. She’s also a member of the IPS Board.</p>

<p>Alison has lived and worked in Suffolk for over 32 years.</p>

<p>She qualified as a librarian in 1979 after studying at the University of Wales (Aberystwyth). Since then she’s worked as a children’s librarian, managed branch libraries and eventually became the lead manager for front line services in 2001. In 2003 she introduced Sunday libraries and self service.</p>

<p>Alison has worked at regional and national levels to develop partnerships and profile for public libraries. In the late 1990s she set and led a regional agency for libraries in the East of England, and in 2009 she led the development and signing of a national agreement between the Department of Health and the public library sector.</p>

<p>Most recently Alison spent four years working in Adult Social Care as head of Information and Advice.</p>

<p>Alison’s other passions are reading, swimming, dancing and Ipswich Town Football Club. She’s also a school governor and is on the Eastern Angles board.</p>

<h3 id="sarah-wilson">Sarah Wilson</h3>

<p>Sarah has lived in Suffolk for over 30 years, and she has been a lifelong lover of reading, and user of public libraries. She is a regular user of Capel St Mary library, and a member of the Library Friends Group, and has been a member of a book group for over 20 years! She volunteers at various book festivals. Sarah is a strong supporter of Suffolk Libraries, and very aware of how lucky we are to have access to such an excellent library service. She values and supports the inclusive and diverse services Suffolk Libraries offers to everyone in the community.</p>

<p>Sarah has had a long, varied and interesting career in the public sector associated with farming and the environment. This originally involved time as an agronomist and farm business adviser in East Suffolk, which was followed by many years working at a broader level in environmental policy, organisational management, business development and change management.</p>
