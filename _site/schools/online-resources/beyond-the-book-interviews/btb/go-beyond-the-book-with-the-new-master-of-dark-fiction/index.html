<p>Do you use social media? How far would you go if you were allowed to tell people exactly what you thought of them on it? Would you be able to stop yourself, or would you really let go and vent your anger and frustration until you knew you were hurting other people? The power of social media takes centre stage in the fantastic YA horror story <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/8158649?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(44636600)&amp;QRYTEXT=Jekyll%27s%20mirror"><cite>Jekyll’s Mirror</cite></a>.</p>

<p>Invited by his English teacher to take part in a social media experiment called ‘Project Hyde’, lead character Sam soon realises that he is both losing control of his emotions and being used by an evil supernatural mastermind. The other students in the experiment do not see the danger and soon their inner demons are unleashed with catastrophic results for the whole country.</p>

<p><img class="fl pr3" src="/images/article/william-hussey-large.jpg" alt="Author William Hussey" /></p>

<p><cite>Jekyll’s Mirror</cite> is an addictive read that left me breathless at times. Sam’s troubled background is handled beautifully by William Hussey, and you really feel for Sam and the amazing Cassandra (who saves Sam multiple times throughout the book). Some of the scenes are truly chilling and pack a real horror punch, and it is of little surprise that <cite>Jekyll’s Mirror</cite> was listed as one of the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/young-adult-books/best-of-2015/">best YA books of 2015 by the Telegraph newspaper</a>. Without giving any spoilers away, my favourite scene was set in a tunnel with hoards of rampaging monsters wreaking havoc. An episode set in a road side cafe will be giving me nightmares for the rest of the year!</p>

<p>We asked William Hussey to go ‘Beyond the Book’ with us. Check out his answers below that include some great writing advice and excellent book recommendations from the ‘new master of dark fiction’. Also be sure to <a href="http://www.williamhussey.co.uk/">visit his website</a> for loads of background information on his stories!</p>

<h3 id="hello-there-where-in-the-world-are-you-today">Hello there, where in the world are you today?</h3>

<p>Hello! I’m in my home town of Skegness, Lincolnshire (fish and chips, Kiss-Me-Quick hats, a Jolly Fisherman running like a loon down the beach, you get the idea), sitting at my desk like this…</p>

<p><img src="/images/article/william-hussey-selfie.jpg" alt="A photo of author William Hussey" /></p>

<p>I’m stuck on a particularly knotty plot point. Something to do with how a murderer might escape from a locked room without using the door or window. The usual Tuesday afternoon conundrum for a writer of ghoulish yarns!</p>

<h3 id="what-can-you-see-from-your-window-please-send-a-picture-or-drawing-if-possible">What can you see from your window? (please send a picture or drawing if possible!)</h3>

<p>This.</p>

<p><img src="/images/article/william-hussey-window.jpg" alt="William Hussey's window view" /></p>

<p>Not a very inspiring view, but the more boring the better. <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/8791312?QRY=CAUBIB%3C%20IRN(95252)&amp;QRYTEXT=Fleming%2C%20Ian%2C%201908-1964">Ian Fleming</a> (the bloke who wrote the James Bond books) did all his writing in Jamaica at his luxurious villa just by the sea. I don’t think I’d get any writing done at all if I was distracted by paradise every day! His view looked like this.</p>

<p><img src="/images/article/ian-fleming-view.jpg" alt="Picture of a tropical island" /></p>

<h3 id="how-many-words-have-you-written-today">How many words have you written today?</h3>

<p>Barely 800. It’s been a tricky day writing-wise. I have a 2,500 word target which I must achieve every day. Sometimes I’m on a roll and can get this done by mid-afternoon, other times I’m still at my desk in the early hours of the morning. But I must get to 2,500 mark before I’m allowed to go to bed.</p>

<p>I think it’s very useful to set yourself a word target if you want to be a serious writer. Start off with something achievable, a few hundred words, and work your way up from there. But if you just hang around until those mythical Muses descend you’ll never finish anything.</p>

<h3 id="whats-on-your-to-read-bookshelf-please-send-us-a-shelfie-if-possible">What’s on your ‘to read’ bookshelf? (please send us a shelfie if possible!)</h3>

<p>Unfortunately I can’t send you a shelfie as my books are packed up for a move at the moment. But my upcoming reads include <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/8792685?QRY=CAUBIB%3C%20IRN(494806)&amp;QRYTEXT=Newman%2C%20Kim">Kim Newman</a>‘s <cite>DRACULA CHA CHA CHA</cite>, the third book in his excellent alternative history series in which Dracula turns up in different roles throughout the 20th Century. I’m also looking forward to finishing the last book in Will Hill’s fantastic <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/8793727?QRY=SEBIB%3C%20IRN(263676)&amp;QRYTEXT=Department%2019"><cite>DEPARTMENT 19</cite></a> series. More Dracula! Yay!</p>

<h3 id="if-you-could-be-transported-into-the-plot-of-any-book-which-one-would-you-pick-would-you-try-and-change-what-happens-in-the-plot">If you could be transported into the plot of any book which one would you pick? Would you try and change what happens in the plot!?</h3>

<p>Oooh. Toughie. You see, the thing with books is they’re all about conflict, and I don’t really like conflict and confrontation much in real life! Plus, the books I most like to read are horrors and thrillers and crime novels, so something really horrible would probably happen to me! All that said, I’d love to accompany Dr Watson and Sherlock Holmes on one of their cases. I’d probably choose <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/8794880?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(91984)&amp;QRYTEXT=The%20sign%20of%20four"><cite>The Sign of Four</cite></a>, just for the creepiness of the first murder and the thrilling boat chase down the Thames at the end. I wouldn’t change one smidge of the plot as Conan Doyle was a genius and The Sign of Four is a masterpiece. Well, maybe I would ask Watson to open a window at 221b Baker Street – I can’t stand the smell of pipe smoke!</p>

<h3 id="it-is-the-year-2115-what-does-the-world-of-books-and-reading-look-like">It is the year 2115. What does the world of books and reading look like?</h3>

<p>I’m pretty hopeful it won’t look much different to today. A few years back everyone thought that the era of the proper physical book was over and that we’d all be reading on Kindles etc., but figures just out show that paper books are selling more than eBooks again. I think we’ll always love the feel of a book in our hands, the smell of the page. Somehow the very act of holding a book helps to transport us into the story, as if this papery bundle is a doorway, carved from the ancient heart of a tree. There’s magic in that idea which I think we’ll always go back to, no matter how much technology advances.</p>

<p>I only hope that places like libraries still exist in 2115 and that short-sighted politicians haven’t starved them out of existence!</p>

<h3 id="we-have-built-a-rocket-to-send-to-mars-it-is-a-wonderful-rocket-but-rather-small-if-we-were-to-send-only-one-book-for-the-aliens-to-read-which-book-would-you-choose-to-sum-up-what-life-is-like-here-on-earth">We have built a rocket to send to Mars. It is a wonderful rocket but rather small. If we were to send only one book for the aliens to read, which book would you choose to sum up what life is like here on Earth?</h3>

<p>Crikey. Very, very difficult. I’m going to with Charles Dickens’ <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/8795871?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(43187)&amp;QRYTEXT=A%20tale%20of%20two%20cities"><cite>A Tale of Two Cities</cite></a>. My reasons are, firstly, Charles Dickens is the planet’s greatest storyteller! Forget Shakespeare (he nicked all his plots!), it’s Dickens who would keep our alien friends riveted right up to the devastating conclusion. Secondly, Dickens would give them a few laughs. His comedy doesn’t really age and his larger-than-life characters always raise a smile. For me, comedy is the hardest art form and is, perhaps, humanity’s greatest achievement. The ability to laugh at ourselves keeps us grounded. Lastly, and most importantly, <cite>A Tale of Two Cities</cite> tells us not to a judge a person on first appearances (or a book by its cover!) and never to underestimate the courage of the human race.</p>

<p>If an alien looked at Earth and watched the human race for a time he/she/it might easily conclude we’re a pretty awful species – mean and cruel and warlike. But that is the very least of us. If they looked closer they would probably find the spirit of Sydney Carton, the complex hero of the novel, in us too. We aspire to do better, to be better, and even if we often fall short, still we try again. That’s pretty wonderful.</p>
