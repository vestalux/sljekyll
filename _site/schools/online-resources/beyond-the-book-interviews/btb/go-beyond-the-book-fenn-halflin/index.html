                        <p class="f3">I always slept easy while living in Birmingham, safe in the knowledge that rising sea levels would be unlikely to get my feet wet. Since moving to Suffolk this outlook has changed somewhat and after reading the brilliant <cite><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/9834044?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(62309591)&amp;QRYTEXT=Fenn%20Halflin%20and%20the%20Fearzero">Fenn Halflin and the Fearzero</a></cite> by Francesca Armour-Chelu, I am seriously contemplating investing in a boat.</p>

<p>The opening prologue to <cite>Fenn Halflin and the Fearzero</cite> introduces the reader to an apocalyptically dark and flooded world where warring factions fight to survive, and to gain control of any remaining dry land. The ruling Terra Firma army hunt down and stamp out members of a secret resistance, who in turn take to the seas to evade their oppressors. It is a terrifying world that young Fenn Halflin might not survive.</p>

<p>From the very first line we are thrown a frightening boat chase as Fenn’s parents are brutally hunted down in by ruthless Terra Firma soldiers and their hideous leader, Chilstone. Fenn’s parents hide their Fenn deep inside their ship moments before their capture; not knowing that Chilstone will have the vessel sunk with their precious child still inside.</p>

<p><img src="/images/article/fenn-halfin.jpg" class="fl mr3 mb3 " alt="Fenn Halflin and the Fearzero" /></p>

<p>The infant Fenn is rescued by the curmudgeonly Halflin; a wonderfully cantankerous old sea dog who raises Fenn as his grandchild in strict secrecy. Their life is fraught for many years until the fateful day the Terra Firma return, and Halflin is forced to send the boy far away to safety. Even now things don’t go to plan as Fenn is abandoned on the dangerous oil-rig Shanties. Here he must once again fight for his survival, and for the truth about his parents’ involvement in the resistance.</p>

<p><cite>Fenn Halflin and the Fearzero</cite> is a wonderful tale about trust, friendship and survival. Francesca Armour-Chelu has created some wonderfully evil characters that you cannot but loathe. I never thought I would one day be rooting for a mongoose either!</p>

<p>There is a gripping sense of danger throughout the story that keeps the reader hooked and wanting to find out more. I can’t wait for the next episode: <cite>Fenn Halflin and the Rising of the Seaborn</cite>.</p>

<p>We asked Francesca to go <em>Beyond the Book</em> with us and she said yes!</p>

<h2 id="hello-there-where-in-the-world-are-you-today">Hello there, where in the world are you today?</h2>

<p>At my desk (actually an old kitchen table) in my house in Suffolk.</p>

<h2 id="what-can-you-see-from-your-window">What can you see from your window?</h2>

<p><img src="/images/article/fenn-view.jpg" alt="Francesca's garden view" /></p>

<p>My window box and a little bit of front garden, which makes me look like I’m an OK gardener. They say pictures don’t lie. They do. That garden is my Dorian Gray, my back garden the slowly deforming portrait.</p>

<h2 id="how-many-words-have-you-written-today">How many words have you written today?</h2>

<p>Mainly those in this questionnaire (don’t tell my editor) I’m writing the second draft of the sequel to <cite>Fenn Halflin and the Fearzero</cite>; my first drafts tend to be too long as I know I’ll cut back hard in the second draft. Right now it’s more razing than writing.</p>

<h2 id="whats-on-your-8216to-read8217-bookshelf-please-send-us-a-shelfie-if-possible">What’s on your ‘to read’ bookshelf? (please send us a shelfie if possible!)</h2>

<p><img src="/images/article/fenn-shelfie.jpg" alt="Francesca's bookshelf" /></p>

<p>I have dozens of books to read and am permanently embarrassed about how few I finish. Working in a library is great since you get recommendations and see new titles arrive but you also feel constantly on the back foot with reading. How do people find time to read so much!? As you’ll see from the photo I’m now choosing books by their BMI - I stand a better chance of finishing skinny ones.</p>

<h2 id="if-you-could-be-transported-into-the-plot-of-any-book-which-one-would-you-pick">If you could be transported into the plot of any book which one would you pick?</h2>

<p>If I’m living in the book then it has to be <cite><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/9835413?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(50190610)&amp;QRYTEXT=Pippi%20Longstocking%20in%20the%20South%20Seas">Pippi Longstocking in the South Seas</a></cite> by Astrid Lindgren. Plot change? As I’m only in that one book, I’m not sharing with those Settergren kids who have Pippi all to themselves in the other titles. So it’ll just me and Pippi hanging out, teaching sharks how to behave, fishing for pearls and spitting off clifftops. But so long as I don’t have to live in the book can I please change the ending of <cite>The Road</cite> by Cormac McCarthy? It’s just too sad and bleak</p>

<h2 id="imagine-it-is-the-year-2116-what-does-the-world-of-books-and-reading-look-like">Imagine it is the year 2116. What does the world of books and reading look like?</h2>

<p>Fenn Halflin is set in the future where paper is a rare commodity, books are scavenged, and any book is a lucky find. I’d hate books to ever be a lucky find, but I also think we take them a bit for granted. Public libraries are amazing - shouldn’t we be more amazed? As for technological advances, I can tell you what I’d like: I read English and Drama at university and the reading list was insane: the bible (both versions) every Shakespeare, Dickens etc! I left 3 years later still not having caught up. I’d love some way of knowing the stuff I should have read but haven’t, maybe dream transfusions of some sort; you’d imbibe stories as you slept…? I’m stealing from the BFG here.</p>

<h2 id="we-have-built-a-rocket-to-send-to-mars-it-is-a-wonderful-rocket-but-rather-small-if-we-were-to-send-only-one-book-for-the-aliens-to-read-which-book-would-you-choose-to-sum-up-what-life-is-like-here-on-earth">We have built a rocket to send to Mars. It is a wonderful rocket but rather small. If we were to send only one book for the aliens to read, which book would you choose to sum up what life is like here on Earth?</h2>

<p>I can’t think of just one book that’d do that, so I’ll send up Pippi Longstocking instead; if aliens think all the little girls on planet earth are that strong they’ll think twice before invading. Also Pippi represents (to me) the best of human spirit; she’s generous, subversive, wild, funny, a cock-a-snooker at self-importance but above all - kind.</p>
