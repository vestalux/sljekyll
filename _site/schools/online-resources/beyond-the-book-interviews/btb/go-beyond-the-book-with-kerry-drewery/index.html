                        <p>One of my favourite films of the eighties is <cite>The Running Man</cite> starring the acting prowess of Mr A. Schwarzenegger and based on an idea originally penned by Stephen King. I found the idea of turning the punishment of criminals into prime-time entertainment terrifyingly fascinating. So I jumped at the chance of reading an advance proof of book with a similar concept. And <cite>Cell 7</cite> by Kerry Drewery did not disappoint.</p>

<p><img src="/images/article/cell7.jpg" class="fr ml3 mb3 " alt="Cell 7" /></p>

<p><cite>Cell 7</cite> is set in a world where the fate of those accused of murder is decided by members of the general public via a telephone vote. Evidence about the crime and information on the accused is presented to the public via prime-time television shows. If the public decide you are innocent, you are set free. But if you are voted guilty you will fry in the electric chair. The accused are held in prison cells, with their every move televised to the nation. True democratised justice? I don’t think so!</p>

<p>The accused in <cite>Cell 7</cite> is sixteen-year-old Martha who has confessed to killing a celebrity famed for his charity work. Martha admits to the crime, and when arrested told police ‘I did it. I shot him. I killed Jackson Paige.’ Imprisoned in cell 1 when we first meet her, and with the public vote strongly in favour of an-eye-for-an-eye, Martha will be executed when she reaches cell 7. Only her designated counsellor, Eve Stanton, can offer any hope…</p>

<p>I loved <cite>Cell 7</cite> for its page-turning power; I was hooked after the prologue and quickly devoured it. Kerry Drewery uses a range of styles to ramp up the suspense and tease the plot along. I genuinely felt angry whilst reading the brilliant transcripts of the TV show ‘Death is Justice’ with its loathsome presenters and skewed version of truth.</p>

<p><cite>Cell 7</cite> is a book that stays with you long after finishing it, and one that poses the reader with many questions. In a recent assembly I presented the basic plot and details of the Martha’s ‘crime’ to 250 key stage 3 pupils and asked them to vote. The result was an interesting split between ‘live’, ‘die’ and play no part by abstaining.</p>

<p>In <cite>Cell 7</cite>, Kerry Drewery delivers a piercing satire on the cult of celebrity, democracy and how the media delivers ‘information’. Cell 7 deserves to be read by as many young adults as possible, and I would love to see it appearing on the GCSE syllabus.</p>

<p>We asked Kerry Drewery to go ‘Beyond the Book’ with us and are delighted that she agreed! Kerry has some brilliant books to check out on her ‘to read list’ and some great ideas about the future of reading!</p>

<h2 id="hello-there-where-in-the-world-are-you-today">Hello there, where in the world are you today?</h2>

<p>I’m in a (quite large) village in Lincolnshire, which is about five miles from the sea and about the same to the Wolds. That’s a good place for me because I love both the sea and the countryside.</p>

<h2 id="what-can-you-see-from-your-window-please-send-a-picture-or-drawing-if-possible">What can you see from your window? (please send a picture or drawing if possible!)</h2>

<p><img src="/images/article/cell-7-p1.jpg" alt="Astrid the dog" /></p>

<p>It’s a lovely day here at the moment, and I’m sitting outside on the patio. I’m not a very good gardener so I won’t be sharing a photo of lots of plants and flowers, but with me at the minute is my dog, Astrid.</p>

<h2 id="how-many-words-have-you-written-today">How many words have you written today?</h2>

<p>Not many at all. I started off with good intentions, but my son starts sixth form next week so we’ve had to go out and buy shoes and smart trousers which took ages. After finishing this to you, I’ll sit down to work and will hopefully get around a thousand words done. I’d usually aim for more like two and a half thousand.</p>

<h2 id="whats-on-your-to-read-bookshelf-please-send-us-a-shelfie-if-possible">What’s on your ‘to read’ bookshelf? (please send us a shelfie if possible!)</h2>

<p><img src="/images/article/cell-7-p2.jpg" alt="A shelfie" /></p>

I do prefer print books to Kindle though.</p>

<h2 id="if-you-could-be-transported-into-the-plot-of-any-book-which-one-would-you-pick-would-you-try-and-change-what-happens-in-the-plot">If you could be transported into the plot of any book, which one would you pick? Would you try and change what happens in the plot!?</h2>

<p>Good grief that’s a good question. I can think of lots of plots I wouldn’t like to be transported into! Ok, <i>thinks hard</i>Hellip; Can I choose two? For sheer fun I think I’d go into Norton Juster’s <cite><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/14325354?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(115128)&amp;QRYTEXT=The%20phantom%20tollbooth">The Phantom Tollbooth</a></cite> – I’d not change anything, I’d just enjoy exploring the bizarre world of Dictionopolis and Digitopolis, the Sea of Knowledge, the Valley of Sound and the Foothills of Confusion (which I think would particularly suit me well!). For something a little more challenging I’d go into John Wyndham’s <cite><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/14325969?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(25554)&amp;QRYTEXT=The%20day%20of%20the%20triffids">The Day of the Triffids</a></cite> which is a story about monstrous attacking plants, and I’d help the main character, William Masen, as he fights for survival.</p>

<h2 id="imagine-the-year-is-2116-what-does-the-world-of-books-and-reading-look-like">Imagine the year is 2116. What does the world of books and reading look like?</h2>

<p>People will never stop telling stories – that’s just part of us – instead it’s the way in which stories are told that alters, and that’s linked to changes in technology. It’s hard to think how much things have changed over the last 100 years and how much they’ll change again in the next 100. Kindles, or some kind of electronic reading device, are great because they’re so convenient, but physical books are very special to people and often real works of art. It’s so much easier for people to share their writing now with the internet too. I can’t see us leaving books behind completely.</p>

<p>What I’d really like is if someone could invent a way of reading while walking the dog – not audiobooks because I find it difficult to stay concentrated on them – but some kind of way of reading while walking, or running, but without the huge risk of falling over or walking into a lamppost.</p>

<h2 id="we-have-built-a-rocket-to-send-to-mars-it-is-a-wonderful-rocket-but-rather-small-if-we-were-to-send-only-one-book-for-the-aliens-to-read-which-book-would-you-choose-to-sum-up-what-life-is-like-here-on-earth">We have built a rocket to send to Mars. It is a wonderful rocket but rather small. If we were to send only one book for the aliens to read, which book would you choose to sum up what life is like here on Earth?</h2>

<p>Hmmmm… so assuming we trying to befriend the aliens we better not send them any horror, or any science fiction that might make them think we’re more advanced than we are, but then is any fiction going to sum up what life is like here? That’s very hard. I think I’d have to go with an encyclopedia!</p>
