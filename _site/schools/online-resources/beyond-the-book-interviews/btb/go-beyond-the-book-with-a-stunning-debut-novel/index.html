                        <p><img src="/images/featured/featured-more-of-me.jpg" alt="More of Me" /></p>

<p>It was the tagline on the cover of <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/9149768?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(58482051)&amp;QRYTEXT=More%20of%20me"><cite>More of Me</cite></a> that first grabbed my attention – ‘Twelve girls. One Identity’. That and the distorted and haunting image of a girl looking out into the distance. Then I read the first few lines of the prologue:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have grown in strength inside her. Filled her cells with mine until we split apart. It’s not my choice – that’s how it’s always been for us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“You what now?” I remember thinking before flipping the book over to look at the blurb.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Teva’s life seems normal: school, friends, boyfriend. But at home she hides an impossible secret. Eleven other Tevas.</p>

  <p>Because once a year, Teva separates into two, leaving a younger version of herself stuck at the same age, in the same house… watching the new Teva live the life that she’d been living. But as her seventeenth birthday rolls around, Teva is determined not to let it happen again. She’s going to fight for her future. Even if that means fighting herself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Intrigued, I went back to the start and got stuck in, and then sucked in, to this amazingly weird and wonderful book. I finished it in two sittings. It would have been in one go but we were on holiday and apparently this means you should visit local attractions…</p>

<p>The plot is set six months after the latest ‘split’ described in the prologue. The current Teva is acutely aware that the next split in six months time will cast her aside, leaving her without a purpose and isolated from the rest of the world. As the book twists and turns, Teva tries to balance the daily stresses of teenage life with finding a way to prevent the next split from taking place. Standing in her way is her sister and previous Teva, now lacking an identity and known only as Fifteen, who is determined to get her life back. Hiding the truth from her friends, Teva searches for answers and a solution to her unique problem.</p>

<p><cite>More of Me</cite> serves up a gripping blend of teenage identity crisis, science fiction and romance. The writing is very accessible with some scenes that are not for the squeamish, but these are handled sensitively by Kathryn Evans. The description of the family home paints a vivid picture of sadness and desolation with the various ‘Teva sisters’ imprisoned both within its walls and within their never aging bodies. Their story will stay with me for a long time to come.</p>

<p><img class="fl pr3" src="/images/article/kathryn-evans-large.jpg" alt="Portrait of Kathryn Evans" /></p>

<p>We asked Kathryn Evans to go ‘Beyond the Book’ with us and she said yes! You can find out about her fruit that’s fit for a queen, what she would like to do to Voldemort and what the sadly departed Louise Rennsion could teach those pesky aliens on Mars.</p>

<p>Kathryn has an amazing <a href="https://mrsbung.wordpress.com/">website</a> and blog you should definitely check out with information for her readers and advice for writers. She also wrote a brilliant piece for the Guardian where she selected her <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2016/feb/04/top-10-childrens-books-about-multiple-personalities">top 10 children’s books about multiple personalities</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Hello there, where in the world are you today?</strong></p>

<p>I’m on my farm today – we grow strawberries and raspberries that end up all over the place – not least Buckingham Palace garden parties…</p>

<p><img src="/images/article/kathryn-evans-window.jpg" alt="View from Kathryn Evans' window" /></p>

<p><strong>What can you see from your window?</strong></p>

<p>It’s not pretty. I can see across the farm track to the farm main offices – mine is in the house because of the ridiculous hours I work (so I’m always around for my children).</p>

<p><strong>How many words have you written today?</strong></p>

<p>None on my book! Aaargh – and I have a deadline… Don’t tell my agent.</p>

<p><img src="/images/article/kathryn-evans-shelfie.jpg" alt="The books on Kathryn's shelf" /></p>

<p><strong>What’s on your ‘to read’ bookshelf? (please send us a shelfie if possible!)</strong></p>

<p>I’m currently reading <cite>The Windrunner’s Daughter</cite> by <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/9157290?QRY=CAUBIB%3C%20IRN(23528153)&amp;QRYTEXT=Pearce%2C%20Bryony%2C%201976-%20author">Bryony Pearce</a>, next is <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/9158027?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(57309757)&amp;QRYTEXT=The%20many%20worlds%20of%20Albie%20Bright"><cite>The Many Worlds of Albie Bright</cite></a> by Christopher Edge. I’ve always got more books I want to read than time to read them!</p>

<p><strong>If you could be transported into the plot of any book which one would you pick?</strong></p>

<p>Would you try and change what happens in the plot!? Oh my, that’s the kind of  question that could make your head explode …I’d like to be there before Voldemort kills Harry’s mother, hiding in a cupboard armed with a basilisk fang – ready to strike!  But then of course the stories wouldn’t happen and the world of children’s books wouldn’t change forever – so maybe Harry has to be an orphan! But wait, Harry isn’t real and…. BOOM! Head exploded…</p>

<p><strong>It is the year 2115. What does the world of books and reading look like?</strong></p>

<p>I think, I hope, we’ll have a mix of print and ebooks – ebooks will have got a bit more spangly with sound tracks and more interactivity but print books will get even more beautiful so that people still want to own them. There’ll be equal representation of books by peoples of all colours and genders and the government will stop forcing people to read things they hate for exams. This is my book Utopia. I’ll be dead by 2115 so I won’t be around to  be disappointed if it doesn’t happen.</p>

<p><strong>We have built a rocket to send to Mars. It is a wonderful rocket but rather small. If we were to send only one book for the aliens to read, which book would you choose to sum up what life is like here on Earth?</strong></p>

<p>Louise Rennison died on 29 February, she was far too young. Nobody wrote about teenage life like she did. I’d send <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/9156523?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(202236)&amp;QRYTEXT=Angus%2C%20thongs%20and%20full-frontal%20snogging%20%3A%20confessions%20of%20Georgia%20Nicolson"><cite>Angus, Thongs and Full Frontal Snogging</cite></a> – that way, if it made the martians want to visit, they’d clearly be pretty cool with humanity in all its weirdness – and if it put them off? We probably wouldn’t make such great neighbours anyway.</p>
