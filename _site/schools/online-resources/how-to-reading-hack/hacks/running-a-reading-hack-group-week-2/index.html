<h2 id="week-2">Week 2</h2>

<p>We began by looking at the response to the <a href="https://twitter.com/mjes/status/720889728992735232">#BookFace tweets</a> we sent out last week. The pupils were impressed by the number of retweets and likes they had got, and that a <a href="https://twitter.com/LineLibrary">library in Tennessee, USA</a> had liked one of them! One pupil commented that that was thousands of miles away! This was a great way to talk about promoting what we are doing which fits in with the ‘Spreading the Word’ element of Reading Hack.</p>

<p><img class="fl pr3" src="/images/article/reading-hack-pupils-making-top-trumps.jpg" alt="Pupils making Top Trumps" /></p>

<p>I was keen that the pupils start to take ownership of the group by giving them more choice in what they were going to do in this session. I had prepared and brought along three hacks for the group to try which were based on our discussions last week. The offer was a <a href="/assets/doc/beyond-the-book-story-cube-hack.doc">Story Cube Hack using Rory’s Story Cubes</a>, a <a href="/assets/doc/beyond-the-book-comic-hack.doc">Comic/Manga Hack</a>, and a <a href="/assets/doc/beyond-the-book-top-trump-hack.doc">Top Trump Hack</a>. They had a free choice in which they did and I encouraged them to try more than one.</p>

<p>The group all chose to try the Top Trump activity first (<a href="/assets/doc/beyond-the-book-top-trump-hack-template.doc">using a template</a>) and soon some great discussions were flowing about how many points to award Katniss for intelligence and whether Chewbacca could be considered a book character (turns out he is in graphic novels and books about Star Wars, so yes).</p>

<p><img class="fr pl3" src="/images/article/reading-hack-pupil-on-a-laptop.jpg" alt="Pupil using a laptop" /></p>

<p>Whilst they were doing this I worked with individuals to <a href="http://readinghack.org.uk/signup">create accounts</a> on the Reading Hack website and join our <a href="http://readinghack.org.uk/groups/23">Hack group</a>. A few of the pupils had tried over the past week but had struggled to create an account. They all had their school email address to use which is important an email address is required as part of the sign up.</p>

<p>I thought that the sign up process was relatively easy, but it does require quite a few buttons to click which confused some pupils. In hindsight, showing part of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y60XE8FMrAg">explanation video</a> might have helped, but it is 12 minutes long and we have no projector to use. There is also a survey to complete as part of the process that takes up some time.</p>

<p>The pupils all worked on the Top Trumps at varying speeds and when one girl had completed her eight cards she immediately picked up the Story Hack and began that. This was really positive!</p>

<p>I had already added the Top Trump hack as an <a href="http://readinghack.org.uk/hacks/170">online activity</a> on the Reading Hack website so pupils with an account logged in, joined the hack, commented on it and clicked to say that they had finished it. The girl working on the Story Hack noticed that there was no hack online for this activity and asked if she could create one. This was brilliant as it showed that the group understood how the hacks worked online. She will add the hack either before or at the next session.</p>

<p><img src="/images/article/reading-hack-home-made-top-trumps.jpg" alt="Home-made Top Trumps" /></p>

<p>We ran out of time to add all of the pictures onto our cards so will finish them next week and have our first game. Next week I am going to challenge the hackers to create their own Hacks and publish them on the website.</p>

<h2 id="hints-and-tips">Hints and Tips</h2>

<p><strong>Creating the account:</strong> pupils could spend hours perfecting the eyebrows on their avatars. I recommend a time limit and encourage them to tweak them in their own time (this will get them familiar with navigating the website).</p>

<p><strong>Creating hacks:</strong> Now we are in week 2 I feel that pupils have a firm grasp on the concept and like the idea of hacks. The hack sheets I have created mimic those online and hopefully have strengthened pupil understanding. Remember that these are year 7 pupils – older hackers might grasp the concept sooner. Next week there will be no paper hacks and pupils will create their own and post them online. They can also create a #BookFace Hack using a <a href="http://readinghack.org.uk/designs/123">Hack Design template</a> already available on the Reading Agency website.</p>

<h2 id="lessons-learnt-from-last-week">Lessons learnt from last week</h2>

<p><strong>Creating the online group</strong>: I was wrong in setting up the online group as this should have been done by the young people themselves. I discovered this by finding a useful <a href="https://readingagency.org.uk/young-people/reading-hack-groups/using-the-reading-hack-website.html">webpage</a> and <a href="https://readingagency.org.uk/young-people/Using%20the%20Reading%20Hack%20website%20V4.pdf">document</a>&lt;/a&gt; on the Reading Agency website with information about explaining the website to young people and <a href="https://readingagency.org.uk/young-people/Website%20tasks%20for%20young%20people%27s%20sessions.pptx">setting them tasks</a>&lt;/a&gt;. Hopefully I will be able to pass on the role of leader in our Beccles Book Bunnies group and delete my profile once we are up and running.</p>
