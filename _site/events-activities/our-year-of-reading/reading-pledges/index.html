<p>“This year I pledge to read at least two books a month, trying for three. I have in the past managed a book a week, but not sure I can do that again as housework does need to be done sometimes!”</p>
<p class="tr">‒ Belinda</p>
</div>

<div class="bg-light-gray pa2 pa3-ns b--gray mb2 mb4-ns

<p>“Not to read more - already addicted and housework suffers - but to read more widely.</p>
<p>Reading has always been important to me; no children nearby. Children's Hour on radio, 5-6pm brought Uncle Mac and Toytown and I still have a Toytown Annual; also a Princess Elizabeth Gift Book. Well meaning relatives gave me Coral Island, Children of the New Forest, Treasure Island,  Robinson Crusoe, and both volumes of Alice. No Blytons; in the thirties she had probably made no impact on older people. I spent birthday money on Mickey Mouse and Rupert.</p>
<p>The local library opened when I was seven, with Arthur Ransome, Brent-Dyer and the Jolly Books, annuals edited, I think, by Herbert and Eleanor Farjeon,. Evacuation, in 1939, where I read Angela Brazil, and The Pilgrim's Progress, and after School Certificate in an underground shelter with V1s overhead, to relatives where I discovered crime anthologies and the Wild West Magazine.</p>
<p>When I left school at 16 my father had retired, money and University places were hard to come by, I had two choices which would enable me to 'learn and earn'; Nursing and Librarianship. This has led to a career in libraries, and in retirement a developing interest in writing, shared with a variety of new friends in the Sudbury Library Top Time group, resurrected in 2015. For me, reading and writing are essential to each other.”</p>

<div class="bg-light-gray pa2 pa3-ns b--gray mb2 mb4-ns

<p>“I think reading is important because it gives us multiple contexts within which we can form our ideal selves. Through adventures we can learn to be brave, by reading mysteries we can learn how to observe and puzzle, we discover our own moralities, our notions of right and wrong, explore our emotions, and it all happens in the privacy of our own imaginations. The experience is utterly personal and profoundly enriching.</p>

<p>I pledge to always champion libraries, because it's where I found all the books of my childhood, and I pledge to tell as many people as possible about every book I read and enjoy.”</p>

<p>“I was given a 50 book challenge by a work colleague, it doesn't give you particular titles but suggests a book with a one word title, a book you read as a child, a book you never finished etc. I am really enjoying this challenge and finding books to meet the criteria, I now have more time to read, children left home and am widowed so find books a great way to escape life.”</p>

<p>“I will read one of those books that I have been putting off reading for years!</p>

<p>Reading is wonderful, you can lose yourself in another world for either long or short periods.  You visualise the characters and make up your own mind about them as opposed to seeing them through the director/producers eyes.</p>

<p>I do and will continue to encourage children and young people to read and enjoy it.”</p>

<p>“I used to read a book a week, but since getting married and becoming a responsible grown up I don't make as much time for it as I used to. So my pledge is to reclaim my reading passion and to reserve at least an hour a day for me and my books!”</p>

<div class="bg-light-gray pa2 pa3-ns b--gray mb2 mb4-ns

<p>“I am already a member of the book club at Felixstowe library which meets once a month. This has introduced me to many different types of novels, which I would never have read before and I have enjoyed listening and learning from other people and their opinions on these books. Soon I am retiring from my job and will have all the time in the world to do what I want! This will of course involve more books and I can't wait to tackle the lists I have made of all the books recommended to me. Felixstowe beach, here I come, with chair sunscreen and books!</p>

<p>I would recommend books and book clubs to everyone. It is one of the most pleasurable, enjoyable and pleasurable, cheap pursuits you could wish for! Forget the Kindle, I like to turn the pages of a book!!”</p>

<p>“Try books outside my usual ‘comfort zone’.”</p>

<div class="bg-light-gray pa2 pa3-ns b--gray mb2 mb4-ns

<p>“I have read addictively all my life. When I was 10, my school report said ‘Alice reads too much. We hope she learns to curb it’! Fortunately the library keeps me well supplied as otherwise there would be no room to move in my house. Over the years I have read a number of the classics but I have also read an awful lot of trash too. So my reading pledge is to change the balance of my reading material and tick off some of those books that as a readaholic I should have read. Maybe one day I might read <cite>War and Peace</cite>!”</p>

<p>“I'm going to read one book every month this year. All full length novels and all classics that I should have read by now but haven't yet!”</p>
<p class="tr">‒ Tom Veasey</p>
</div>

<div class="bg-light-gray pa2 pa3-ns b--gray mb2 mb4-ns

<p>“My reading pledge is to read some poetry every day. I usually read lots of fiction but have always found poetry a bit hard going. That said, I recently saw the brilliant David Harmer performing some of his poetry and really enjoyed it! I have now got a few poetry books beside my bed to get me started (<cite>Crow</cite> by Ted Hughes and a Philip Larkin collection). Maybe in getting older I can finally get my head around poems and poets!</p>
<p>For me, reading is an eternal quest to find that one book that explains what we  are doing floating around on this chunk of rock surrounded by stars.”</p>
