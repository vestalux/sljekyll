                    <p>Ancient myths have interested me since hearing Iron Maiden during my teenage years (they wrote a song about the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4w2BZXL6Ss">Icarus myth</a>) so I was very excited when I got my hands on a copy of Philip Womack’s <cite><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/18507517?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(59641538)&amp;QRYTEXT=The%20double%20axe">The Double Axe</a></cite>.<figure></figure></p>

<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Double-Axe-Cover-1-100x150.jpg" alt="The Double Axe Book Cover" />&lt;/figure&gt;</p>

<p><cite>The Double Axe&lt;/a&gt;</cite> is the first book in the <cite>Blood and Fire</cite> series which cleverly retells myths from the viewpoint of its teenage characters. Through the eyes of thirteen year old Prince Deucalion Stephanos (Stephan to his friends), we are introduced to the ancient world of Crete and the legend of the <a href="http://www.almabooks.com/page.html?id=81">Minotaur</a>.</p>

<p>For a coming of age tale, Stephan has been dealt a rough hand to say the least. He unwillingly kills a female deer whilst on a royal hunt and is duly cursed by the local priestess. His older brother is killed in dubious circumstances which forces his father, the King, to travel to Athens. Stephan remains behind as Prince Regent with a nasty feeling that vultures are starting to circle his family. Without revealing any spoilers, Stephan must protect his family by outwitting the scheming priestess and the shadow god she summons. Not exactly the life of your average teenager!</p>

<p>I was captivated by <cite>The Double Axe</cite> and consumed it in two sittings. The characters have a real depth to them; from the intelligence and warmth of Princess Ari to the truly despicable depravity of priestess Myrrah. The various locations in the ancient world (such as the palace of Knossos) are beautifully described and the additional historical detail given by the author paints some beautiful pictures. I loved the political plot twists throughout the story and can see young readers devouring the pacy action. Be warned: it is quite dark in places and might not be suitable for the squeamish. I can’t wait for the next book in the series!<figure></figure></p>

<p>We asked Philip Womack to go ‘Beyond the Book’ with us. Check out Philip’s answers below which include some excellent book recommendations; I’ve just reserved <cite><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/18510393?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(999739)&amp;QRYTEXT=The%20golem">The Golum</a></cite> by Gustav Meyrink, that apparently involves a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homunculus">homunculus</a> that appears once every 33 years in a room without a door.</p>

<p>Also be sure to visit Philip’s website where you can read some of his <a href="http://philipwomack.blogspot.co.uk/p/short-stories.html">short stories</a>!</p>

<p>I think I would have loved to be in the plot of <cite>The Lord of the Rings</cite>, as a supporting elf. I wouldn’t change anything, though, although I did rather like Minas Tirith and thought they should spend more time there and less time in horsey Rohan.</p>

<p>As the world becomes more digitised, a hunger for the tangible will return; books will become more and more beautiful and ornate. I think things will look pretty much as they do now – only we’ll all be connected to each other via the internet. Probably.</p>

It is a wonderful rocket but rather small. If we were to send only one book for the aliens to read, which book would you choose to sum up what life is like here on Earth?</h3>

<p>How big is the book? Could we paste them all together? Failing that… I think it would have to be one of the great Victorian novels. Since I’ve just finished <cite><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/18519574?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(53525)&amp;QRYTEXT=Middlemarch">Middlemarch</a></cite>, I would suggest that as a good indication of human psychology and manners; if not that, then Tolstoy’s <cite><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/18521132?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(59536)&amp;QRYTEXT=War%20and%20peace">War and Peace</a></cite>, as it sums us up pretty well.<figure></figure></p>
