<p>I’ve had a few pets throughout my life: a dog called Tilly, a pair of goldfish called Bubble and Squeak and rabbit called Peter who, according to my Father, mysteriously managed to escape from his hutch to go and live on a distant farm. None of my pets would have been of any use had my Father been kidnapped by an evil scientist intent on global domination. What I <em>would</em> need is an eccentric archaeologist, two super brave mates and a pet rhinoceros beetle called Baxter to help me save the day. Luckily for Darkus Cuttle, star of the wonderful <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/13092280?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(87360)&amp;QRYTEXT=Beetle%20boy"><cite>Beetle Boy</cite></a>, this motley crew is at hand when he needs them most.</p>

<p><img class="fl pr3" src="/images/article/beetle-boy-illustration-beetle-in-cup.jpg" alt="Beetle in a tea mug" /></p>

<p><em>Illustration by Júlia Sardà</em></p>

<p>Beetle expert Dr Bartholomew Cuttle vanishes suddenly from inside a locked room at the Natural History Museum. The police are stumped, and have all but given up trying to solve the case. Dr Cuttle’s son Darkus is determined to find out the truth: he just needs to survive starting a new school whilst avoiding the haphazard parenting of his Uncle Max first. Clues to the Dr’s whereabouts start coming in thick and fast when the vile cousins next door start scrapping in the street, a large beetle helps Darkus fight off the local bullies and the truly terrifying Lucretia Cutter appears on the scene. Darkus just needs to piece these clues together…</p>

<p><cite>Beetle Boy</cite> is a wonderful, romping tale filled with hundreds of wonderful characters – most of them not even human! Darkus calls upon a vast array of beetles to help him throughout the story, with each using their unique bodies to support him on his quest. Want a lock opening without a key? Try the defensive acid from a bombardier beetle. Need to slow down two villains as they try to attack you? Get some dung beetles to throw some dung at them!</p>

<p>I loved <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/13092280?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(87360)&amp;QRYTEXT=Beetle%20boy"><cite>Beetle Boy</cite></a> for its mystery, its humour and the warm glow it gives you as you root for Darkus. My favourite scene involves a side-splitting misunderstanding in Chapter 12 between Darkus and Novak Cutter - the wannabe actor/daughter of a super villain. I can’t wait to meet all the characters again, beetles included, in the forthcoming sequel <cite>Beetle Queen</cite>!</p>

<p>We asked M.G. Leonard to go ‘Beyond the Book’ with us and she said <em>‘does a firefly produce bioluminescence in the dark!’</em> (she actually said she would be ‘honoured’, I think the beetles might have got to me!).</p>

<p>Find out where she is on her UK promotional tour of <cite>Beetle Boy</cite>, where she thinks the Sorting Hat would send her at Hogwarts and how her sweet tooth would alter a beloved children’s story. She has also put together a whopping list of amazing recommended reads!</p>

<p>You should also buzz on over to her <a href="http://www.mgleonard.com/">website</a> to find out more about her writing and the amazing world of beetles!</p>

<p><strong>Hello there, where in the world are you today?</strong></p>

<p>I’m in a B&amp;B, on a promotional tour for Beetle Boy, in Berwick-Upon-Tweed, Northumberland.</p>

<p><strong>What can you see from your window? (please send a picture or drawing if possible!)</strong></p>

<p><img class="fr pl3" src="/images/article/m-g-leonard-river-tweed.jpg" alt="Bridge over the River Tweed" /></p>

<p>I can see the river Tweed and the most amazing bridge. It’s beautiful!</p>

<p><strong>How many words have you written today?</strong></p>

<p>I haven’t written any book words today, but I have written lots of article/blog post type words. I’m at the stage in my book, <cite>Beetle Queen</cite>, where I’m deleting words and changing words in the manuscript. This is just as much work as writing the first draft, but you don’t have a word count goal to cheer you on.</p>

<p><strong>What’s on your ‘to read’ bookshelf? (please send us a shelfie if possible!).</strong></p>

<p>So many books! I have a bookshelf next to my bed and on four of the shelves I stack my ‘to read’ books.</p>

<p><strong>If you could be transported into the plot of any book which one would you pick? Would you try and change what happens in the plot!?</strong></p>

<p>Okay, so this question made my brain EXPLODE! Too many choices. I would have loved to go to Hogwarts, although I’m worried I would’ve been sorted into Slytherin. I yearn to experience Lyra’s Oxford and I spent my childhood checking the back of large wardrobes for Narnia, but if I were to be transported into a book, I’d want to win a golden ticket and go to Willy Wonka’s Chocolate Factory, as long as I got to be Charlie Bucket. I wouldn’t want to change the plot, however when they get into the great glass elevator I would have stopped it from going into outer space and got down to the business of making fantastic sweets! I was so disappointed by The Great Glass Elevator, because I loved Charlie and the Chocolate Factory so dearly.</p>

<p><strong>It is the year 2115. What does the world of books and reading look like?</strong></p>

<p>The printed book will be king, but they will be ornate, expensive luxury items. In the magical gap between the printed book and the digital world will spring up a new form of storytelling which will cross all media and people will become obsessed with immersing themselves inside trans-media stories, which they can read, hear, touch, see and smell. You will be able to choose which character journey to follow and how you want to experience that journey. It will be awesome. The ultimate place to experience these all encompassing narratives will be libraries.</p>

<p><strong>We have built a rocket to send to Mars. It is a wonderful rocket, but rather small.
If we were to send only one book for the aliens to read, which book would you choose to sum up what life is like here on Earth?</strong></p>

<p>I would send Matt Haig’s book <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/13131082?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(19965180)&amp;QRYTEXT=The%20humans"><em>The Humans</em></a>. It’s a wonderful, humourous and poignant exploration of what it means to be human and live on planet earth.</p>
