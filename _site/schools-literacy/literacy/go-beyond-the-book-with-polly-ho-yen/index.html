<em>The Boy in the Tower by Polly Ho-Yen</em></p>

<p>Welcome to our final Beyond the Book author profile of the 2015-2016 academic year. We have already featured <a href="">thirteen other amazing authors</a> and found out where they write, what they are reading and which book they would send to Mars for the aliens to read.</p>

<p>Today we thought we would finish on a high by reviewing not one, but two amazing books from the super talented Polly Ho-Yen, before challenging her to go ‘Beyond the Book’ with us!</p>

<p><img src="/images/article/polly-ho-yen-felixstowe-library.jpg" alt="Polly-Ho Yen at Felixstowe Library" /></p>

<p>Once again, I have the amazing staff at <a href="/libraries/felixstowe-library">Felixstowe Library</a> to thank for introducing me to another brillint author (they also recommended the cracking <a href="/schools-literacy/literacy/go-beyond-the-book-with-the-author-of-stonebird">Stonebird by Mike Revell</a>). As part of the <a href="http://felixstowebookfestival.co.uk/">Felixstowe Book Festival</a>, library staff worked with local primary schools to read <cite>Boy in the Tower</cite> by Polly, and to then interview her at an event at the festival in June. Intrigued, I grabbed a copy of <cite>Boy in the Tower</cite> and started to read.</p>

<p>This is how <cite>Boy in the Tower</cite> begins:</p>

<blockquote>When you wish that a Saturday was actually a Monday, you know that there is something seriously wrong.</blockquote>

<p><img class="fr ml3 mb3 " src="/images/article/boy-in-the-tower-toy-horse.jpg" alt="Boy in the Tower book and a toy horse" /></p>

<p>These are the words of Ade, a boy who lives in a tower block and who can see the whole world beneath him. But Ade’s world is under attack from the mysterious Bluchers; destructive plants that are devouring the buildings outside his window and levelling the land around his tower block. Before Ade and his best friend Gaia can solve the mystery of the Bluchers; Gaia disappears, his neighbours abandon their homes, and Ade is trapped in his flat with his seriously ill mother as the Bluchers encircle his tower block. The food, water and electricity start to run out, and slowly drain what is left of Ade’s hope. The feeling of isolation is choking Ade, until one day a bottle of water is left outside their door. Maybe Ade isn’t alone after all…</p>

<p><cite>Boy in the Tower</cite> is an astonishing book that takes you on an emotional rollercoaster ride with the hero Ade. There are some wonderful characters, and the menacing Bluchers are truly terrifying! It was clear that the primary pupils loved the book as much as I did, and we were all excited to hear that Polly had written a new book called <cite>Where Monsters Lie</cite>! Could it match the intensity and wonderful storytelling of the first book? I had to find out…</p>

<p><img class="fl mr3 mb3 " src="/images/article/where-monsters-lie-large.jpg" alt="Where monsters lie" /></p>

<p><cite>Where Monsters Lie</cite> is in many ways a complete opposite to <cite>Boy in the Tower</cite>. The narrator this time is a young girl, Effie, and the setting is switched from urban tower blocks to a cottage in a small, rural village. But the wonderful storytelling, amazing supporting characters and twisting plot is back, making <cite>Where Monsters Lie</cite> a gripping read.</p>

<p>Effie lives in Mivtown, a village dominated by a huge loch that exerts immense power over the locals. Twice a year the villagers make an offering to the loch in the hope that they can prevent a disaster. But when Effie’s pet rabbit disappears, closely followed by her mum, Effie wonders if the oddball villagers and the mysterious loch are to blame. She sets out to get some answers, risking upsetting the peaceful village, and her life, along the way.</p>

<p><cite>Where Monsters Lie</cite> is an absorbing read that drags you into the dark and menacing world of Mivtown. The immersive plot and mesmerising descriptions entice you to solve the mystery with Effie, as she and her best friend Finn struggle towards the truth.</p>

<p>Polly Ho-Yen has quickly become one of my favourite authors, and she reminds me very much of another favourite of mine; David Almond. Both are delicious writers whose words appeal to all five senses as you read, and both use settings and locations as another, often ominous, character. I can’t wait for Polly’s third book to arrive.</p>

<p><img class="fl mr3 mb3 " src="/images/article/polly-ho-yen.jpg" alt="Polly Ho-Yen" /></p>

<p>We asked Polly Ho-Yen to go Beyond the Book with us, and she said ‘<cite>do Bluchers like concrete!</cite>’ (that’s a yes!). Polly has a brilliant <a href="https://pollyhoyen.com/">website</a> you should visit, where you can read about her life as a writer and how she visited <a href="https://pollyhoyen.com/category/libraries/">30 libraries in 30 days</a> (including Felixstowe Library). And make sure both <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/15154538?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(38360053)&amp;QRYTEXT=Boy%20in%20the%20tower"><cite>Boy in the Tower</cite></a> and <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/15155043?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(62778243)&amp;QRYTEXT=Where%20monsters%20lie"><cite>Where Monsters Lie</cite></a> make it onto your bookshelf soon!</p>

<p><strong>Hello there, where in the world are you today?</strong></p>

<p>I am with my sister and my nephew in their flat. They are having a noisy ‘bathtime-time’ as I type.</p>

<p><strong>What can you see from your window? (please send a picture or drawing if possible!)</strong></p>

<p>A lot of ivy and a wall. It’s a basement flat and so you do feel slightly mole-like here.</p>

<p><strong>How many words have you written today?</strong></p>

<p>Not enough because I was having an invoice and catching up with emails day today - boring but necessary!</p>

<p><strong>What’s on your ‘to read’ bookshelf? (please send us a shelfie if possible!)</strong></p>

<p>My ‘to read’ bookshelf is too big to think about so this is what’s in my rucksack…</p>

(I loved <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/15157033?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(1086572)&amp;QRYTEXT=The%20weight%20of%20water"><cite>The Weight of Water</cite></a> and <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/15156654?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(182142)&amp;QRYTEXT=One"><cite>One</cite></a>, but had missed Apple and Rain and was not disappointed.)</p>

<p>And I’m almost always rereading a favourite from the past and at the moment it’s <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/15159199?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(134125)&amp;QRYTEXT=One%20good%20turn"><cite>One Good Turn</cite></a> by Kate Atkinson.</p>

<p><strong>If you could be transported into the plot of any book which one would you pick? Would you try and change what happens in the plot!?</strong></p>

<p>Yikes! I think I would like to be transported into <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/15159736?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(20749576)&amp;QRYTEXT=Neverwhere%20%3A%20the%20author%27s%20preferred%20text"><cite>Neverwhere</cite></a> - I’d like to (but am scared to) visit London Below as I spend so much time in London Above. Neil Gaiman got it perfect but I was so shocked and sad when Anaesthesia was taken on the Night’s Bridge and though I know she shouldn’t really come back, I would like her to.</p>

<p><strong>It is the year 2116. What does the world of books and reading look like?</strong></p>

<p>I still think that we will have physical books! Digital books will be used for some things and have their place but physical books will be the thing. Libraries will have been developed and so that they are at the centre of everything. I envisage plastic tubes that will ‘shoot’ books directly into home and are hoovered back up into a central library when they are finished.</p>

<p><strong>We have built a rocket to send to Mars. It is a wonderful rocket but rather small. If we were to send only one book for the aliens to read, which book would you choose to sum up what life is like here on Earth?</strong></p>

<p>I think <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/15160251?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(462767)&amp;QRYTEXT=Beegu"><cite>Beegu</cite></a> by Alexis Deacon - it would be fantastic if the aliens were the same sort as Beegu but not essential. I think it’s a very realistic portrayal of what life is like on Earth - it shows both the disappointment and joy, the loneliness and the union, that so many of us experience in our lives. (Also a nice thin book for the small but wonderful rocket!)</p>
