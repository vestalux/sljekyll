<p>This book is in the style of <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1708889"><cite>H is for Hawk</cite></a> and <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2079073"><cite>The January Man</cite></a>, being a mixture of the natural world and the personal world, grieving and exploring both internally and externally.</p>

<p>It is about the break up of Alys’s marriage and her falling in love again and about her immersion in the new world of Birmingham’s back street canals. In the style of a kayak trip there is much to see and experience as the story unfolds.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“As a teenager Vanessa plays a game with her father: they take turns to ask a question and the other must answer truthfully. One day Vanessa asks: ‘Apart from with Mummy, have you ever been so in love that you would have liked to marry someone else?’ Her father is visibly shaken and as the truth emerges it becomes clear why.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A memoir by the granddaughter of Vita Sackville-West, this beautifully written recollection of the friends, lovers and family who have played a vital role in Vanessa’s life is a stunning sequel to <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1900477"><cite>Have You Been Good?</cite></a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“At 7 years old Min Kym was a prodigy, the youngest ever pupil at the Purcell School of Music. At 11 she won her first international prize. She worked with many violins, waiting for the day she would play ‘the one’. At 21 she found it: a rare 1696 Stradivarius, perfectly suited to her build and temperament. Her career soared. She recorded the Brahms concerto and a world tour was planned.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Then, in a train station cafe, her violin was stolen. In an instant her world collapsed. She descended into a terrifying limbo land, unable to play another note. This is Min’s extraordinary story - of a young woman staring into the void, wondering who she was, who she had been.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“<cite>The Secrets of My Life</cite> looks at Caitlyn Jenner’s childhood as Bruce Jenner and rise to fame as a gold-medal-winning Olympic decathlete; her marriages and her relationships with her children; her transition; and her experience as the world’s most famous transgender woman.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“A natural on a horse since he was able to walk and imbued with a pure love of riding, Declan Murphy became one of the most brilliant jockeys of his generation before his world came crashing down at the final hurdle of a race at Haydock Park. His skull shattered in 12 places, he was believed to be dead, the last rites were read and the Racing Post published his obituary.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Miraculously - and the word is not used lightly - he survived and defied medical thinking in recovering to the extent that 18 months after his fall he was able to saddle up for one more race.”</p>

<p>For those of you who have discovered Hygge this book explores classic and contemporary Scandinavian style.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Scandinavia is famous for its distinctive style: homes are pared-back and simple, and form and function are combined to create aesthetically pleasing and practical interiors. Scandinavians are inspired by light, having an abundance of it in summer but so little of it in winter, and house designs tend to maximize the amount of natural light that enters the home, and allow the inhabitants to make the most of outdoor life during the summer.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Similarly, nature and the weather are major influences: homes are made warm and cosy for the freezing winter months - not just literally with log burners, but also through incorporating wood and natural materials. <cite>The Scandinavian Home</cite> showcases a wide range of these beautiful homes.”</p>

<p>Lizzie Armitstead will be familiar to many Suffolk readers as one of the leading lights on the Women’s Cycling Tour which has visited Suffolk recently.</p>

<p>Born in Otley, West Yorkshire, in 1988, Lizzie Armitstead won her first medal in the Junior World Track Championships in 2005 after being talent spotted at school, before going on to win silver at the 2012 Olympics Games in London. In this account of her career Lizzie takes the reader into the world of the women’s tour and Olympic Games and the challenges faced by one of its most gifted competitors: from sexism and the fight for equality, to doping and the incredible sacrifices required to self-coach herself to world titles.”</p>
