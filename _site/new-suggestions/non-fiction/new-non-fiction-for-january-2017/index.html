<h2 id="citepassage-across-the-merseycite-by-robert-forresterhttpssuffolkspyduscoukcgi-binspydusexeenqopacbibenqbrn2078975"><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2078975"><cite>Passage Across the Mersey</cite>, by Robert Forrester</a></h2>

<p>Many people will remember Helen Forrester’s books which tell the moving story of a Liverpool childhood in the Depression era.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When Helen Forrester’s father went bankrupt in the 1930s, she and her six siblings fell from a comfortable middle-class existence into wretched poverty. Later in life, Helen wrote her series of memoirs, starting with <cite>Twopence to Cross the Mersey</cite>, which told of her family’s struggles. It was a story filled with tragedy and small triumphs but many readers wondered what happened to Helen when she grew up; what became of the fragile young girl who had so much responsibility heaped on her shoulders? Now for the first time, her son Robert recounts the unexpected life that Helen went on to live; of the remarkable love story with a young man from a background a million miles away from everything a Lancashire lass like Helen would have known and of the astonishing lengths she went to in order to achieve happiness.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Istanbul has always been a place where stories and histories collide and crackle, where the idea is as potent as the historical fact. From the Qu’ran to Shakespeare, this city with three names - Byzantium, Constantinople, Istanbul - resonates as an idea and a place, and overspills its boundaries - real and imagined. In this epic biography, author Bettany Hughes takes us on a dazzling historical journey through the many incarnations of one of the world’s greatest cities.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In July 1992, three weeks before his third birthday, Alex Hanscombe watched the frenzied and brutal attack by a complete stranger that left his mother, Rachel Nickell, dead. They had been walking their dog on Wimbledon Common, in broad daylight. The story stunned the nation. Within hours it dominated news bulletins, even before family and friends had time to be informed. Alex’s family took every step to protect him as they were laid siege by the media. Meanwhile his father and a child psychologist worked painstakingly to coax vital clues from Alex. The investigation expanded into one of the largest and most controversial in police history, but the case remained unresolved for almost two decades.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“On the morning of July 28, 1540, as King Henry’s VIII’s former confidante Thomas Cromwell was being led to his execution, a teenager named Catherine Howard began her reign as queen of a country simmering with rebellion and terrifying uncertainty. Sixteen months later, the king’s fifth wife would follow her cousin Anne Boleyn to the scaffold, having been convicted of adultery and high treason.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The broad outlines of Catherine’s career might be familiar, but her story up until now has been incomplete. Unlike previous accounts of her life, which portray her as a naïve victim of an ambitious family, this compelling and authoritative biography will shed new light on Catherine Howard’s rise and downfall by reexamining her motives and showing her in her context, a milieu that goes beyond her family and the influential men of the court to include the aristocrats and, most critically, the servants who surrounded her and who, in the end, conspired against her. By illuminating Catherine’s entwined upstairs/downstairs worlds as well as societal tensions beyond the palace walls, the author offers a fascinating portrayal of court life in the sixteenth century and a fresh analysis of the forces beyond Catherine’s control that led to her execution — from diplomatic pressure and international politics to the long-festering resentments against the queen’s household at court.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Based on fascinating new material, this title provides a riveting account of Catherine Howard’s tragic marriage to one of history’s most powerful and endlessly fascinating rulers.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Anne Brontë is the forgotten Brontë sister, overshadowed by her older siblings - virtuous, successful Charlotte, free-spirited Emily and dissolute Branwell. Tragic, virginal, sweet, stoic, selfless, Anne. The less talented Brontë, the other Brontë. Or that’s what Samantha Ellis, a life-long Emily and <cite>Wuthering Heights</cite> devotee, had always thought. Until, that is, she started questioning that devotion and, in looking more closely at Emily and Charlotte, found herself confronted by Anne instead.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><cite>Take Courage</cite> is a poignant and surprising journey into the life and work of a woman sidelined by history.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“David Hockney is one of the most influential British artists of the past century, and arguably the country’s greatest living painter. He has spent his life dedicated to drawing, oil painting, printmaking, set design and photocollage, and more recently has extended his practice into watercolour, charcoal, multi-camera video installation and digital drawing. This publication explores the artist’s output over the past decade. Includes essays by Simon Maidment, Martin Gayford, Li Bowen, Barbara Bolt and Edith Devaney, as well as a selection of David Hockney’s extraordinary works.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a major exhibition of Hockney’s work at Tate Britain in February 2017.</p>
