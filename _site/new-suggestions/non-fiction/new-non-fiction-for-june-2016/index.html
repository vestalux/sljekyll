<p class="mt0">On his 17th birthday, Adrian Doherty was offered a five-year contract - unprecedented for a Manchester United youngster at that time - and told by Alex Ferguson that he was destined for stardom. A contemporary of Ryan Wilson (Giggs) and Paul Scholes he was a certainty to become a superstar. But what followed over the next decade is a tale so mysterious, so shocking, so unusual, ultimately so tragic, that you are left wondering how on earth it has been untold for so long.</p>

<p class="mt0">"Dear Mama, I am having a lovely time here. We play football every day here. The beds have no springs." So begins the first letter that a nine-year-old Roald Dahl penned to his mother, Sofie Magdalene, under the watchful eye of his boarding-school headmaster. For most of his life, Roald Dahl continued to write weekly letters to his mother, chronicling his adventures, frustrations and opinions, from the delights of childhood to the excitements of flying as a World War II fighter pilot and the thrill of meeting top politicians and movie stars during his time as a diplomat and spy in Washington. And, unbeknown to Roald, his mother lovingly kept every single one of them. Sofie was, in many ways, Roald's first reader. It was she who encouraged him to tell stories and nourished his desire to fabricate, exaggerate and entertain.</p>

<p class="mt0">Nowadays Chris Boardman is probably best known as the co-presenter of ITV's Tour de France coverage, but beyond the TV persona Chris Boardman is one of our greatest cyclists. Boardman's achievements in the 80s and 90s - Olympic track gold, the world hour record, repeatedly claiming the yellow jersey in the Tour de France - were the spark that started the modern era for British cycling.</p>
