<p>This whimsical fairy-tale spent seven weeks on New York Times’ best seller list, reaching number two on the hard cover fiction list.</p>

<p>A stunning collection of occasional writings, interviews, and letters by Elena Ferrante, “one of the great novelists of our times,” as Roxana Robinson in the <cite>New York Times</cite> called her.</p>

Ferrante’s voice is as direct, penetrating, acute, inspiring, and intimate as it is in her acclaimed novels.</p>
