<p>Donna Leon’s bestselling mystery novels set in Venice have won a devoted following in Suffolk Libraries. Commissario Guido Brunetti has been an enduring figure. A good man who loves his family and his city, Brunetti is relentless in his pursuit of truth and some measure of justice.</p>

During an interrogation of an entitled, arrogant man suspected of giving drugs to a young girl who then died, Brunetti acts rashly, doing something he will quickly come to regret. In the fallout, he realises that he needs a break, to get away from the stifling problems of his work.</p>

<p>When the caretaker of the house where he is staying goes missing, though, Brunetti feels compelled to investigate.</p>
