<p>DCI Banks returns in the hugely popular crime series.</p>

<p>When two boys vanish under mysterious circumstances, the local community is filled with unease. And when a caravan belonging to one of the youths is burned to the ground, and a bloodstain is discovered in a disused World War Two hangar nearby, things quickly become much more sinister.</p>

<p>Assigned to the case, DCI Banks and his team are baffled by the mystery laid out before them. But when a motor accident throws up a gruesome discovery, the investigation spins into a higher gear – and in another direction.</p>

<p>Carlotta O’Keefe is happily engaged, and the wedding plans are coming together. She’s clear about her future path, both personally and in her busy career. Maybe Chris doesn’t make her heart race every time she sees him, but you can’t have that feeling for ever. Can you?</p>

<p>Then, on a trip to Seville, Carlotta runs into Luke Evans. Luke broke her heart so long ago she’d almost convinced herself she’d forgotten him. Now, he’s not that boy any more, but an attractive and intriguing man. And he can explain everything that happened way back when. Suddenly Carlotta’s not so sure of anything any more. The perfect summer distraction…</p>

<p>1961: Born on the day that WW2 broke out, 21-year-old Fay Knox cannot remember her early childhood in London, before she moved to a Norfolk village with her mother, Kitty.</p>

<p>Though she has seen a photograph of her father, she does not recall him either. He died, she was told, in an air raid, and their house destroyed along with all their possessions.</p>

<p>Why then, on a visit to Paris on tour with her orchestra, does a strange series of events suggest that she spent the war there instead? There is only one clue to follow, an address on the luggage label of an old canvas satchel. But will the truth hurt or heal?</p>

<p>In the summer of 1940, most eyes are focussed on the skies above the South of England. The battle for Britain has just begun. But young Evie Lucas has eyes for no-one but a dashing young pilot called Tony.</p>

<p>Evie has a glittering career as an artist, and she wants his parents to have something to remember him by in case it all goes wrong in the war.</p>

<p>Seventy years later, and art historian Lucy uncovers the mystery surrounding a painting in her home – and accidentally ends up stirring up a hornet’s nest of history–</p>

<p>London, 2011. In the early hours of a summer morning, a young woman is killed by a bus. A tragic accident? Or suicide? A year later, her devastated husband, Adrian Wolfe, is determined to find out.</p>

<p>Adrian and Maya had only recently married, and he’d always believed they were happy together. His children from his two previous marriages loved her. And Maya loved them. She had a job she enjoyed, she had plenty of friends, and she and Adrian were trying for a baby. They seemed to have the perfect life. Why then might she have wanted to kill herself?</p>

<p>When Adrian finds a hidden stash of poisonous emails on Maya’s laptop he begins to identify the dark cracks in her life.</p>

<p>“It’s a dead man… Can’t you see someone’s put a bloody great spike through him?” The discovery of a dead banker sends shock waves through the sleepy coastal town of Ayr. And it’s up to DI Bob Valentine – recently back on the force after his near–fatal stabbing – to find the killer.</p>

<p>But leads are hard to find and the pressure is on from an anxious chief superintendent who is being hounded by the media and still has serious concerns about her DI’s mental health.</p>

<p>And as it becomes clear that there’s a serial killer on the loose, Bob Valentine must battle the demons of his post-traumatic stress, an investigation team that’s leaking like a sieve and frightening visions that might just be the key to unlocking the mystery. Valentine is close to breaking point, but can he crack the case before he cracks up?</p>
