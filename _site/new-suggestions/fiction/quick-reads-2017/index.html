<p>With one in six adults still struggling to read, Quick Reads continues its work to break down the barriers to reading. Since its launch, Quick Reads has distributed over 4.5m books and there have been over 3.5m library loans.</p>

<p>The collection for 2017 is guaranteed to entertain as well as help emergent readers on their reading journey. Each year, Quick Reads publishes six short, plot-filled books written by well-known authors. They are designed to help people who have lost the reading habit or struggle with aspects of reading. If you enjoy reading these authors you are welcome to borrow them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Lorna lives on the tiny Scottish island of Mure, a peaceful place where everyone helps their neighbour. But the local GP is retiring, and nobody wants his job. Mure is too small and too remote.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Far away, in a crowded camp, Saif is treating a little boy with a badly-cut hand. Saif is a refugee, but he’s also a doctor: exactly what Mure needs. Saif is welcome in Mure, but can he forget his past? Over one summer, Saif will find a place to call home, and Lorna’s life will change forever.”</p>

Behind its high fences is a place of safety. Here, he can hide like a wounded beast. He can find food,and healing - and learn how to do more than survive.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“But when Will meets Padma, he must choose between his good side and his bad one. For the gang he left behind is still there. How can he live without becoming a killer? How can he love without being a thief? Exciting, fast-paced and different, this is a story that keeps you reading until the last line.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Lisa has sworn off love and relationships after a really bad experience, but lately she’s been tempted to take a chance on a more exciting life. First she meets other fans of the TV show <cite>Poldark</cite> online. Then she proposes a very special road trip to Cornwall, in search of where their favourite show is being filmed. But can four strangers find friendship, as well as a certain sexy hunk, on their trip south?”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Hayley swore when she got out of prison that she would turn her life around. But living on the Devil’s Estate doesn’t make that easy. She spends her days looking after her daughter, and her nights collecting cash from people who can’t get loans any other way. But someone has just robbed her. And she has 24 hours to get the money back, or her boss will come for her. Her criminal ex-boyfriend says he can help. Hayley wants nothing to do with him. But time is running out, and she has to choose - save herself, or save her soul? If she makes one false move, her life will be over.”</p>
