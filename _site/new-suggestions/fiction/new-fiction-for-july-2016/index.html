<p class="mt0">Strictly speaking in library terms this is non-fiction as it is a play, but anyone wanting to read it will read it as fiction. This is the ‘event’ publication for July and it will be everywhere.</p>

<p>It was always difficult being Harry Potter and it isn't much easier now that he is an overworked employee of the Ministry of Magic, a husband, and father of three school-age children. While Harry grapples with a past that refuses to stay where it belongs, his youngest son Albus must struggle with the weight of a family legacy he never wanted. As past and present fuse ominously, both father and son learn the uncomfortable truth: sometimes, darkness comes from unexpected places. </p>

<p class="mt0">The newly promoted Detective Superintendent Alan Banks becomes embroiled in one of his most perplexing and distressing cases in the latest bestseller from Peter Robinson.</p>

<p>Two women. Two crimes.The first is a poet claiming she was assaulted fifty years earlier by entertainer Danny Caxton now regarded as one of the country’s national treasures. And the second is a girl found on a remote roadside, her body broken, her life snuffed out. As more women step forward with accounts of Caxton's manipulation, Banks must piece together decades old evidence. For Detective Inspector Annie Cabbot, the lifeless young woman poses a baffling mystery—a mystery that will lead her into the unlikeliest of places, interviewing the unlikeliest of suspects.</p>

<p class="mt0">Ruby and Verity met as girls despite being from contrasting worlds. Verity privately educated, living in a beautiful home, while Ruby was being raised in extreme poverty. Nevertheless they became firm friends. However soon the girls find their situations reversed. As Ruby goes up in the world, Verity encounters more and more tragedy, but still the girls remain a large part of each other's lives. That is until one day in 1938 when Ruby says the terrible words 'You're dead to me' and it looks like their friendship might be over for good.</p>

<p class="mt0">It is 1925 and the war is long over. But much has been lost and life will never be the same again. Castle Deverill, cherished home to the Deverill family in the west of Ireland for hundreds of years, has burned to the ground. But young and flighty Celia Deverill is determined to restore the ruins to their former glory. Celia married well and has the wealth, after all, to keep it in the family and she cannot bear to see it stand neglected. But dark shadows are gathering once more, as the financial markets start to shake. And everything that felt so certain is thrown once again into doubt.</p>

<p class="mt0">Despite their differences, Erika and Clementine have been best friends since they were children. So when Erika needs help, Clementine should be the obvious person to turn to. Or so you'd think. For Clementine, as a mother of two desperately trying to prepare for the audition of a lifetime, the last thing she needs is Erika asking for something, again. When they are invited to a neighbour’s barbeque a whole world of secrets and lies is exposed.</p>

<p class="mt0">The author of The Beach House returns with another heartwarming story of love and family.</p>

<p>Eight years ago, Emma Montague left behind the strict confines of her English life and moved to New York City, where she found success in the world of finance. But her soulless, cut-throat, all-consuming job has only led to another life she didn't want. Answering an online ad, she finds a tiny beach cottage to rent in a small town in Connecticut. It needs a lot of work but it's the perfect project to satisfy her passion for interior design and gardening, if her new landlord, Dominic, is agreeable to the small changes she yearns to make. To Emma, Dominic is also something of a fixer-upper. A local handyman with a 6 year old son, he's a world away from the men she should be interested in, but he's comfortable in his own skin. Slowly, over a shared garden, time spent with his son and late-night conversations, Emma finds herself falling for Dominic. </p>
