<h2 id="sarah-jenkins8217-review">Sarah Jenkins’ review:</h2>

<p>I was hooked by the main character of Maud as soon as I started to read this book. Maud is gradually starting to forget lots of things but she does keep remembering that her dear friend Elizabeth is missing but no one will take her concerns seriously.</p>

<p>I love the way the author describes Maud’s attempts to keep her thoughts in order by writing lots of notes that tumble out of bags and pockets. I love the way Maud is always buying tinned peaches to add to the enormous amount she already has in her kitchen cupboard. I love how we are able to see inside Maud’s mind as we are privy to her internal dialogue, especially when she is confused by what is going on around her. Inevitably, Maud’s memory deteriorates during the course of the book and the description of Maud seeing her own daughter as a stranger broke my heart.</p>

<p>A lot of times in this book I found myself getting frustrated — not with Maud, but with the way she tries so hard to get clarity and how it is often just out of reach. The present and the past overlap in Maud’s mind as we find out that when Maud was young, her sister Sukey went missing. The book beautifully takes us between these two mysteries and unlike a lot of books that try to do this, you always know, as the reader, whether you are in the past or present.</p>

<p>I don’t know how Emma Healey managed to write such an insightful book — the empathy shown in the writing by putting herself in Maud’s shoes is overwhelmingly powerful.</p>

<p>I, like many, have loved ones who have been affected with dementia or Alzheimer’s and this book has allowed me to walk in their shoes for a bit and the author has given us two thumping great mysteries to boot.</p>

<p>A fabulous and refreshingly different read.</p>

<h2 id="lesley-dolphin8217s-review">Lesley Dolphin’s review:</h2>

<p>Emma’s book is a who dunnit with a bit of a twist — well actually, a very big twist. The story is told by Maud who’s memory is deteriorating. She writes copious notes to help her keep track but she doesn’t remember things from one day to the next. As the story progresses, Maud doesn’t always recognise her daughter and grand-daughter, but she does remember that her friend Elizabeth is missing and she can’t work out why no one else cares. As Maud’s grasp on the present slips the memories of her early days start to take over and we learn of another mystery — why her young sister Sukey disappeared and where did she go.</p>

<p>Emma has written this with a huge amount of empathy and I really felt that I understood how it must be to be suffering from a condition like Alzheimer’s. The deterioration of Maud through the book is upsetting, particularly when she doesn’t recognise her own daughter but there are moments of humour as well! The characters are very well drawn and I was hooked from the first moment. That there are two mysteries in the story are a bonus!</p>

<h2 id="vanessa-clouting8217s-review">Vanessa Clouting’s review:</h2>

<p>A very interesting and different read — Emma Healey is to be congratulated! She captures beautifully the effects of dementia on the elderly — Maud is delightful, but frustrated, but throughout we have glimpses of her ‘true’ self – her butterfly moments. Loved her relationship with her granddaughter and could sympathise completely with her daughter, who herself became increasing frustrated with Maud’s deterioration. This book was at times, humorous, sad, challenging and complicated, but I’d definitely recommend people to read it, especially if you have ‘dementia’ issues in your family. The past/present whodunnit was very well handled and added to the tension!</p>

<h2 id="sam-pease8217s-review">Sam Pease’s review:</h2>

<p>This is not the sort of book I usually pick up, but I really enjoyed it. Maud reminded me of my 91 year old Nan and I hope I can be more patient with her in the future. I will be passing this book into the rest of my family as I think they will also enjoy it.</p>

<h2 id="julie-moore8217s-review">Julie Moore’s review:</h2>

<p>Really enjoyed this book. The confusion caused by dementia was sensitively handled and the mystery surrounding Elizabeth’s disappearance was intertwined in the story in a clever manner. The characters were very believable, especially the daughter whose frustration with her Mum was very understandable. I have bought a copy for my friend for her birthday.</p>
