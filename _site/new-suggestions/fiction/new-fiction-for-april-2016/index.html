<p>Psychological thriller based at St Oswald’s Grammar School for boys and centred on its Latin teacher, Roy Straitley. If you have ever read any Joanne Harris books you will recognise some familiar themes here, a menacing atmosphere and a mystery from the past. Roy Straitley’s voice is the voice of reason and tradition. He finds it hard to adjust to today’s technology driven society. Still, boys will be boys and a Master always knows his boys, even when they return as adults, ready to take over the old empire and drag it into modernity. I have heard very good reports of this one.</p>

<p>The 25th novel in the series. In this one, Commissario Guido Brunetti investigates the near-drowning of a 15 year old girl. His investigation is complicated by the fact that it is now 15 years later, the only witness to the event was drunk on the night of the incident and was it actually a crime? If you have read the books you will enjoy meeting old friends again. If you have not, Donna Leon vividly brings to life a Venice that is never seen by the tourists.</p>

<p>Firstly, it helps if you have already read <cite>Broken Promise</cite>. This is the second title in a trilogy and it picks up threads from the first book. Barclay tends to leave cliffhangers for his readers so if you read this one you may have to read the series!</p>

<p>After the screen of a run-down drive-in movie cinema collapses and kills four people, the daughter of one of the victims asks private investigator Cal Weaver to look into a recent break-in at her father’s house. Cal discovers a hidden basement room where it’s clear that salacious activities have taken place – as well as evidence of missing DVDs. But his investigation soon becomes more complicated when he realises the DVDs may contain something even more shocking.</p>

<p>Former NFL footballer Amos Decker, newly appointed special agent with the FBI, returns for a second outing. If you read <cite>Memory Man</cite> you will be familiar with his back story. Decker returned from a stakeout one evening to discover his wife, young daughter, and brother-in-law had been murdered. Due to a career ending injury which induced hyperthymesia and synesthesia, Decker has the unique ability to forget nothing which he puts to use in his new career as a policeman.</p>

<p>One of America’s most promising football stars until recently awaits his fate on Death Row, aged twenty-years-old, he was arrested and convicted for the murder of his parents just as he was due to begin a lucrative contract with the NFL. Decker will need all of his extraordinary brainpower to stop an innocent man from being executed for a crime he didn’t commit.</p>

<p>Welcome to Black Springs, the seemingly picturesque Hudson Valley town haunted by the Black Rock Witch, a 17th century woman whose eyes and mouth are sewn shut. Everybody knows that her eyes may never be opened. Because if they are, every living creature in Black Springs is doomed. For years the town has kept itself isolated – and safe. Until the day that, bored and restless, the town’s teenagers film the witch and upload the footage. And when the video goes viral – all hell breaks loose. Thomas Olde Heuvelt is a recent winner of the Hugo Award.</p>

<p>Last novel by the late Paul Torday of <cite>Salmon Fishing in the Yemen</cite> fame. This one is completed by his brother Piers the children’s book writer. It is a strange premise for a book; think Chris Huhne with owls.</p>

<p>Andrew Langford is driving home one night, along a dark country lane, when a barn owl flies into his windscreen. It is an accident. However Andrew is in line to be the country’s next prime minister and he has recently been appointed to a select committee concerned with the Wildlife Crimes Act. Barn Owls are a protected species and it is a crime to kill one. If Andrew acknowledges that he has killed the owl, he could be risking his political career.</p>

<p>Not for the squeamish. Strong language and violence throughout. Irvine Welsh brings back one of modern fiction’s most infamous, terrifying characters, Francis Begbie from <cite>Trainspotting</cite>.</p>
