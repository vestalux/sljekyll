<p>To mark LGBT History Month 2017, we’ve expanded our <a href="/parents-carers-and-children/childrens-ya-books/lgbt-history-month-for-young-people-in-2016/">list of LGBT books for children and young people from 2016</a> to make a bumper list of recommended titles for young adults.</p>

<p>A lot of these books have come from <a href="http://www.junodawson.com/2015/06/28/yougotdiversebooks/">Juno Dawson’s list of diverse YA books</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Jeanette is adopted and brought up by her mother as one of God’s elect. Zealous and passionate, she seems destined for life as a missionary, but then she falls for one of her converts. At sixteen, Jeanette decides to leave the church, her home and her family, for the young woman she loves.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First published in 1985, this title has retained its relevance and fully deserves to be called a ‘classic’.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“With her parents both gone, Ash finds herself a servant in the house of her ruthless stepmother and there seems no hope of finding happiness again. But Ash is unaware of her mother’s legacy, and that it will lead her to a magical place. A place where love, identity and belonging are all waiting.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Flocks of birds are hurling themselves at aeroplanes across America. Thousands of people die. On Reese’s long drive home, a bird flies into their headlights. The car flips over. When they wake up in a military hospital, the doctor won’t tell them what happened. For Reese, though, this is just the start. She can’t remember anything from the time between her accident and the day she woke up almost a month later. She only knows one thing: she’s different now. Torn between longtime crush David and new girl Amber, the real question is: who can she trust?”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Reese and David are not normal teens - not since they were adapted with alien DNA by the Imria, an extraterrestrial race that has been secretly visiting Earth for decades. Now everyone is trying to get to them: the government, the Imria, and a mysterious corporation that would do anything for the upper hand against the aliens.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Joss Moody has died and the jazz world is in mourning. But in death, Joss can no longer guard the secret he kept all his life, and Colman, his son, must confront the truth: the man he believed to be his father was, in fact, a woman.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Girl meets boy. It’s a story as old as time. But what happens when an old story meets a brand new set of circumstances?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Ali Smith’s re-mix of Ovid’s most joyful metamorphosis is a story about the kind of fluidity that can’t be bottled and sold.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It is about girls and boys, girls and girls, love and transformation, a story of puns and doubles, reversals and revelations.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“This is the story of a Scottish childhood of sordid council flats and B&amp;Bs, screeching women, feckless men, fags and booze and drugs, the dole queue and bread and marge sandwiches. It is also the story of an irresistible, irrepressible heroine, a dysfunctional family you can’t help but adore, and the absurdities of the 80s.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“A bright, bold debut about a girl who happens to have been born a boy but refuses to let that stand in the way of her dream, <cite>George</cite> is a pertinent and poignant middle-grade read for kids of all backgrounds.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Gabe has always identified as a boy, but he was born with a girl’s body. With his new public access radio show gaining in popularity, Gabe struggles with romance, friendships, and parents - all while trying to come out as transgendered. An audition for a station in Minneapolis looks like his ticket to a better life in the big city. But his entire future is threatened when several violent guys find out Gabe the popular DJ is also Elizabeth from school.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Max Walker is the golden boy. He’s the perfect son, the perfect friend and the perfect crush for the girls at his school. He’s attractive, he’s intelligent, he’s athletic. He’s even nice to his little brother. But he has a terrible secret. If his secret gets out, his perfect life will be blown apart.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“What if discovering who you really are means letting go of who you’ve been? Toni and Gretchen are the couple everyone envied in high school. They’ve been together forever. They never fight. They’re hopelessly in love. When they separate for their first year at college they’re sure their relationship will stay rock solid.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The reality of being apart, however, is very different. Toni’s discovering a new world - and a new gender identity - but Gretchen struggles to remember who she is outside of their relationship. While Toni worries that she won’t understand Toni’s shifting identity, Gretchen begins to wonder where she fits in to this puzzle. Now they must decide if their love is strong enough to last.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“My name is Amanda. I’m 18. When you look at me, you might see that I’m pretty and popular, you might think my life is easy. But being me has never been easy - because I haven’t always been Amanda. When I was born, I was named Andrew. Now, at my new school, I finally feel like myself. But do I owe my new friends the truth about my past?”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Inspired by a true story, this is an edgy, extravagant novel for young people and others, full of gender-bending teen glamour, dark mischief and enough melodrama to incite the paparazzi.”</p>
</blockquote>

But the neighbourhood around his old house is overgrown, covered in dust and completely abandoned. What’s going on?”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“This bold, irreverent novel powerfully asks what if you weren’t the ‘chosen one’? The one who’s supposed to fight the zombies, or the soul-eating ghosts, or whatever this new thing is, with the blue lights and the death? What if you were like Mikey? Who just wants to graduate and go to prom and maybe finally work up the courage to ask Henna out before someone goes and blows up his high school. Again. Because sometimes there are problems bigger than this week’s end of the world and sometimes you just have to find the extraordinary in your ordinary life. Even if your best friend might just be the God of mountain lions!”</p>

And that’s when she meets the irresistible Nico Mancini, lead singer of a local band - and it’s instalove at first sight! Toria likes Nico, Nico likes Toria but then there’s Polly.”</p>

  <p>“Ashleigh Walker is in love. You know the feeling - that intense, heart-racing, all-consuming emotion that can only come with first love. It’s enough to stop her worrying about bad grades at college. Enough to distract her from her parents’ marriage troubles. There’s just one thing bothering her. Shouldn’t it be her boyfriend, Dylan, who makes her feel this way - not Miss Murray, her English teacher?”</p>

And in Belisaere she is forced to follow the plans, plots and demands of everyone, from her parents to her maid to the sinister Guildmaster Kilip. Clariel can see her freedom slipping away. It seems too that the city itself is descending into chaos, as the ancient rules binding Abhorsen, King and Clayr appear to be disintegrating.”</p>

What the twins don’t realise is that each of them has only half the story and if they can just find their way back to one another, they have a chance to remake their world.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Aristotle is an angry teen with a brother in prison. Dante is a know-it-all who has an unusual way of looking at the world. When they meet at the swimming pool, they seem to have nothing in common. But as the two loners start spending time together, they discover that they share a special kind of friendship - the kind of friendship that changes lives and lasts a lifetime. And it is through their friendship that Ari and Dante will learn the most important truths about themselves - and about the kind of people they want to be.”</p>

  <p>“Ever since Beth Bradley found her way into a hidden London, the presence of its ruthless goddess, Mater Viae, has lurked in the background. Now Mater Viae has returned with deadly consequences. Streets are wracked by convulsions as muscles of wire and pipe go into spasm, bunching the city into a crippled new geography; pavements flare to thousand-degree fevers, incinerating pedestrians; and towers fall, their foundations decayed.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“As the city sickens, so does Beth - her essence now part of this secret London. But when it is revealed that Mater Viae’s plans for dominion stretch far beyond the borders of the city, Beth must make a choice: flee, or sacrifice her city in order to save it.”</p>

Towards the end of October, foreshadowed by the deaths of many relatives before them, Cara’s family becomes inexplicably accident-prone. They banish knives to locked drawers, cover sharp table edges with padding, switch off electrical items - but injuries follow wherever they go, and the accident season becomes an ever-growing obsession and fear. But why are they so cursed? And how can they break free?”</p>
