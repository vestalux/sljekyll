<blockquote>
  <p>“Joe and his friends have moved to the big city and are about to take the music industry by storm. They’re city-slicking, hard-hustling, good-timing boys, and they’re living the dream. But knowing these lads, it could end up turning into a total nightmare! Laugh out loud, inwardly cringe, and get ready for the return of Joe Cowley!”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Millie Porter is fed up of being tragic and is determined to do something a bit out there and not like her normal dull self. With the help of her best friend, she is going to start a vlog. But can she become an online sensation with only a best friend who is fab at contouring and a cat who likes standing on her head? Probably not but she’s going to try. And not even Erin Breeler, Instagram Queen, can stop her.”</p>

<p>From the number one <cite>New York Times</cite> bestselling author of <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2116450"><cite>The Wrath and the Dawn</cite></a> comes a sweeping, action-packed YA adventure set against the backdrop of feudal Japan:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Mariko has always known that being a woman means she’s not in control of her own fate. But Mariko is the daughter of a prominent samurai and a cunning alchemist in her own right, and she refuses to be ignored. When she is ambushed by a group of bandits known as the Black Clan en route to a political marriage to Minamoto Raiden - the emperor’s son - Mariko realises she has two choices: she can wait to be rescued - or she can take matters into her own hands, hunt down the clan and find the person who wants her dead.”</p>

<p>Start of a new trilogy from Teri Terry, queen of the psychological thriller:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“An epidemic is sweeping the country. You are among the infected. There is no cure; and you cannot be permitted to infect others. You are now under quarantine. The 5% of the infected who survive are dangerous and will be taken into the custody of the army. Young runaway Callie survived the disease, but not the so-called treatment. Her brother Kai is still looking for her. And his new friend Shay may hold the key to uncovering what truly happened.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Mara’s senior year is proving to be a lot less exciting than she’d hoped, until the day Katelyn Ogden explodes during third period. Katelyn is the first, but she won’t be the last senior to explode without warning or explanation. The body count grows and the search is on for a reason, while the students continue to pop like balloons. But if bombs or terrorists or a government conspiracy aren’t to blame, what is? With the help of her oldest friend, her new boyfriend, a power ballad and a homemade disco ball, will Mara make it to graduation in one piece? It’s going to be one hell of a year, where the only test is how to stay alive and where falling in love might be the worst thing you can do.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This book, with its unusual premise, has been described as funny and smart.</p>

When she buys him a lottery ticket for his birthday and he wins 32 million dollars, they are thrown together with the world at their feet. Teddy decides that he will spend his money committing random acts of kindness, and who better to go on that adventure with him than Alice? In the process they get to know themselves and each other better than they ever have before, but money can’t buy you love.”</p>
