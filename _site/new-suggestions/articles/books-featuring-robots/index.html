<p>To mark the opening of <a href="https://beta.sciencemuseum.org.uk/robots/">the Science Museum’s major new <cite>Robots</cite> exhibition</a>, as well as the beginning of the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08fg08m">Radio 4 series <cite>The Rise of the Robots</cite></a>, we’ve picked out a selection of great books for all ages that feature robots.</p>

<p>Prefer eBooks and eAudio? We’ve also put together a <a href="https://suffolklibraries.overdrive.com/collection/87587">Rise of the Robots OverDrive shelf</a>.</p>

<p>Ever wondered why they’re called ‘robots’? Czech playwright Karel Čapek coined the word from the Czech verb ‘robota’, ‘to work’.</p>

<p>This list was compiled with the help of Lakenheath Library manager Chris Howard and information and content librarian Lisa Brennan.</p>

But soon Archie starts to behave strangely. What’s got into him? It’s almost as if his programming has gone haywire! The Petbots realise he has downloaded a virus, and it’s up to Flo, Sparky and their new human friends to work out a cure before Archie shuts down for good!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are 3 titles in the Petbots series, and 3 robots who star in them all: Archie the cat, Sparky the mouse and Flo the bird. Their chaotic adventures are the perfect read for children moving on from short chapters to slightly longer reads. This is the second title in the series.</p>

<p>After the mysterious disappearance of her inventor father, Lily travels to London to uncover the truth. Featuring life-like clockwork animals called “mechanicals”, a cast of well-drawn characters and faux Victorian steampunk inventions galore, this is a brilliant read. It’s a corker of a book, a rip-roaring adventure and we hope someone makes it into a film.</p>

It has a name, it speaks, and it can print ANYTHING Olly asks it to - a never-ending supply of sweets, a swimming pool in the shed - but what Olly really wants is his dad, who has separated from his mum and moved out of the family home. Cue the creation of Dad-Bot - he looks just like Dad (on a good day) but is totally chaotic - and his antics tip Olly and co into a heart-racing and heart-warming adventure!”</p>

<p>Published in 1967, this classic allegorical tale about mechanical toys tells of their struggles through a hostile world and their quest to become self-winding. It features some memorable characters such as Manny Rat, the ruthless amoral villain, a fortunetelling frog who preys on the gullible and a troupe of travelling rooks called The Caws of Art. If you haven’t come across it before, give it a try but don’t be deluded by the gentle cover. It’s quite a read.</p>

And when Sammy’s inventor mum becomes distracted by a top-secret project, the robots soon begin to fall into disrepair.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Cue a robot revolt, with the droids wreaking harmless havoc in the house! Armed with pranks like glue in the shampoo bottles and flying toast missiles, the robots demand to be cared for.

<blockquote>
  <p>“Audrey’s father taught her that to stay human in the modern world, she had to build a moat around herself; a moat of books and music, philosophy and dreams. A moat that makes Audrey different from the echoes: sophisticated, emotionless machines, built to resemble humans and to work for human masters. Daniel is an echo - but he’s not like the others. He feels a connection with Audrey; a feeling Daniel knows he was never designed to have, and cannot explain. And when Audrey is placed in terrible danger, he’s determined to save her.”</p>

  <p>“Written when Mary Shelley was only 19 years old, this chilling tale of a young scientist’s desire to create life still resonates today. Victor Frankenstein’s monster is stitched together from the stolen limbs of the dead, and the result is a grotesque being who, rejected by his maker, sets out on a journey to wreak his revenge. In the most famous gothic horror story ever told, Shelley confronts the limitations of science, the nature of human cruelty and the pathway to forgiveness with rich language and evocative imagery.”</p>

And, unless we radically reassess the fundamentals of how our economy and politics work, we risk a future of massive unemployment and inequality as well as the implosion of the economy itself.

<blockquote>
  <p>“One of the most exciting challenges faced by Leonardo was to create robots made to resemble human or animal, or rather automatic self-operating devices. The technological excellence achieved during the XV century and the impetus in Mechanics and Engineering developed in Leonardo a growing interest in humanoid automata and in self-operating machines that still interests many scholars today. Many researchers share the hypothesis that Leonardo studied automata and attempted to sketch some projects on his manuscripts. In fact, pulleys and gears are the real ‘stars’ of the famous folio 216v-b [579r] in the Codex Atlanticus, associated with the project of the automaton or robot. Due to the lack of a main project, this drawing leaves some pending questions.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“This project was the result of the research carried out by the artist in the field of anatomy, studies partially lost and partially recorded in the Codex Huygens, kept at the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York. Therefore Leonardo traced the idea of a sort of Robotics, a so-called anathomia artificialis: studying the human body, he came to the creation of a wonderful humanised machine. The artist-craftsman could not receive a higher consecration. Leonardo’s automata are the subject of this book, which collects the results presented by scholars that have studied Leonardo from different points of view.”</p>
