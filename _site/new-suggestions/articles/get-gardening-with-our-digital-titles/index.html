  <p>“Recounting stories from her hectic life in horticulture, Christine Walkden’s diary is a heartwarming account of octogenarian neighbours, living with a film crew and helping friends with their gardening needs. Reflecting all the charm of her BBC2 television series, Christine’s narrative paints a picture of the day-to-day beauty that surrounds her. She likes being outside, she likes walking her dog Tara, she likes watching the light change and she enjoys those little moments when everything seems right in the world. With irrepressible enthusiasm, she interweaves tips and advice to prove that the best gardens are approachable and achievable.</p>

  <p>“Forget fashion, forget trends - Christine’s garden is about no-nonsense planting and growing what you enjoy. As the year progresses, this warm, but frank diary brings to life all the moments of pride, excitement, relaxation and laugh-out-loud fun that make Christine’s garden a haven of contentment.”</p>

  <p>“Richard Taylor, author of the best-selling <cite>How to Read a Church</cite>, joins forces with garden historian Andrew Eburne to produce the ultimate guide to historic and modern gardens.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Gardens are amongst the fastest-growing visitor attractions today - in the UK alone 15 million people will visit a garden this year. <cite>How to Read an English Garden</cite> is the essential book for every garden lover. It provides an account of the different elements of gardens of all ages and explains their meaning and their history: here, you’ll find the answer to such questions as: when were tulips introduced into our gardens, and what was ‘tulip-mania’? What is a knot-garden, and what was the origin of its design? Who was ‘Capability’ Brown, and how did he get his name? Why are mazes such a common feature in English garden design? In addition, the book explains how lawns, flowerbeds, trees and ponds came to be a feature not just of grand houses but of gardens everywhere.”</p>
