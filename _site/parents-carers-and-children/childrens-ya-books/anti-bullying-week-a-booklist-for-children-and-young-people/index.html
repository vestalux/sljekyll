<p>This week is Anti-Bullying Week. Bullying can happen to <a href="https://www.childline.org.uk/Explore/Bullying/Pages/Bullying.aspx">anyone, at any age and anywhere</a>.</p>

<div class="vid"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f1lzcEq8WgI" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>

<p>We have compiled a range of fiction books that explore themes and topics such as bullying, anxiety, friendship and acceptance to aid discussion and help celebrate kindness throughout the week. There are also some non-fiction books, links to resources and helpline numbers if you need someone to talk to.</p>

<p>Willy wouldn’t hurt a fly — he even apologises when someone hits him. The suburban gorillas call him Willy the Wimp. Then, one day, Willy answers a bodybuilding advertisement — with hilarious results!</p>

<p><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/5371761?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(696346)&amp;QRYTEXT=Little%20Rabbit%20Foo%20Foo"><cite>Little Rabbit Foo Foo</cite> by Michael Rosen</a></p>

<p>He’s wild, he’s wicked, he’s Little Rabbit Foo Foo! The bully-boy bunny likes nothing better than to ride through the forest bopping everyone on the head. Wriggly worms, tigers, no one is safe. But here comes the Good Fairy — and she’s not amused.</p>

<p>Gizmo, Sprinkles and Wild are fed up. Every time they build something with their blocks, Rex wrecks it! Whether it’s an out-of-this-world rocket, a magical heart or the biggest, strongest, most awesomerific castle ever, Rex sends it crashing down with a ‘rawr!’ (and sometimes a sheepish ‘rawry!’). Isn’t there any way to make playtime fun for everyone?</p>

<p>Everyone knows that tyrannosauruses are big and scary, so when a placid duckbill dinosaur’s egg ends up in the wrong nest confusion is sure to ensue. When the baby dinosaur hatches out, he’s so out of place that his grisly big sisters call him Tyrannosaurus Drip.</p>

<p>Nick is stuffed in his locker. Again. It’s not so bad. Lockers are roomier than you’d think — especially when you’re the shortest kid on the planet, which is exactly why Bully-Boy Roy stuffed him in there in the first place. The school counsellor says Roy has issues. The only issue Nick can see is that Roy is a mutant troll. Nick’s friends Molly and Karl think the troll needs to be defeated. Together, they are the Odd Squad!</p>

<p>David Walliams’s beautiful first novel will touch the hearts (and funny bones) of children and adults alike. As one Amazon reviewer puts it, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Boy-Dress-David-Walliams/product-reviews/0007279043">“this story helps to remind us all that we are not all the same, and we must show tolerance for others.”</a></p>

Times are tough for both of them until genius Stewart rescues fashion icon Ashley from her heel of a boyfriend, and in so doing, cements a bond between them.
