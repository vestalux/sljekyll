<p class="mt0">It’s great to find a book which rejects gender stereotyping for young children. Jessica Spanyol’s Clive has a lovely busy day taking his babies to the park, paying them along with his friends then putting them to bed. If you’re looking for positive role models for little boys who sometimes like to do things other than climb, race around furiously and kick balls, there are two other Clive books you may want to look at; <cite>Clive and his bags</cite> and <cite>Clive and his hats</cite>.</p>

<p class="mt0">Just in time for father’s day comes this story about a young father looking back wistfully to his youth spent playing in a band, motorcycling, and getting tattoos. His young son still thinks he's the tops and we think this picture book is all set to become the present to buy for all new dads. Keith Negley’s <cite>Tough guys have feelings</cite> too was published last year, and uses the same playful style of illustration to disguise the softer side of being a boy and a man.</p>

The art work has been re-scanned and the text is bold, clean and easy to read. If you haven’t come across it before, then you’re in for a treat!</p>

But Magnifico is blessed with neither courage nor intelligence, whereas Alfie, with trusty dog Bowser at his side, is truly a hero. It’s full of great characters, it’s funny, Marta Kissi’s illustrations perfectly capture the mood, and Alfie wins fair maid.</p>

One minute, he's living a perfectly ordinary life: school, football, video games, hanging out with best friend Danny. The next, he finds himself sucked into a terrifying dream world, a wasteland where a terrible Darkness plagues his hometown, threatening the lives of everyone in it. Owen can't control when he enters this world, or when he gets to leave. All he knows is that he has to help fight this terrible Darkness. But what is this world? Why is he here? And what if he never gets to go back home?</p>

That kind of thing can really change your perspective. Now Denizen is about to discover that there's a world beyond the one he knows. A world of living darkness where an unseen enemy awaits. Fortunately for humanity, between us and the shadows stand the Knights of the Borrowed Dark. Unfortunately for Denizen, he's one of them. This book has landed on my desk today. I’ve read a chapter and I’m hooked. It’s seriously good.</p>

<p class="mt0">This second title in Steve Cole’s take on the <cite>Young Bond</cite> series is prefaced by that famous quotation, "The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing" (Edmund Burke). But we’ve no need to worry on that front, because Steve Cole like Charlie Higson before him, would never allow our hero “to do nothing” and he’s courageous from the start.
