<p class="mt0">It’s great to find a book which rejects gender stereotyping for young children. Jessica Spanyol’s Clive has a lovely busy day taking his babies to the park, paying them along with his friends then putting them to bed. If you’re looking for positive role models for little boys who sometimes like to do things other than climb, race around furiously and kick balls, there are two other Clive books you may want to look at; <cite>Clive and his bags</cite> and <cite>Clive and his hats</cite>.</p>

<p class="mt0">Just in time for father’s day comes this story about a young father looking back wistfully to his youth spent playing in a band, motorcycling, and getting tattoos. His young son still thinks he's the tops and we think this picture book is all set to become the present to buy for all new dads. Keith Negley’s <cite>Tough guys have feelings</cite> too was published last year, and uses the same playful style of illustration to disguise the softer side of being a boy and a man.</p>

The art work has been re-scanned and the text is bold, clean and easy to read. If you haven’t come across it before, then you’re in for a treat!</p>

It’s sure to entertain the adult reader as well as the listening child. “Lucinda Belinda got hold of the cat. 'No kitten of mine goes out looking like that!' ” - Love it!</p>

But Magnifico is blessed with neither courage nor intelligence, whereas Alfie, with trusty dog Bowser at his side, is truly a hero. It’s full of great characters, it’s funny, Marta Kissi’s illustrations perfectly capture the mood, and Alfie wins fair maid.</p>

One minute, he's living a perfectly ordinary life: school, football, video games, hanging out with best friend Danny. The next, he finds himself sucked into a terrifying dream world, a wasteland where a terrible Darkness plagues his hometown, threatening the lives of everyone in it. Owen can't control when he enters this world, or when he gets to leave. All he knows is that he has to help fight this terrible Darkness. But what is this world? Why is he here? And what if he never gets to go back home?</p>

That kind of thing can really change your perspective. Now Denizen is about to discover that there's a world beyond the one he knows. A world of living darkness where an unseen enemy awaits. Fortunately for humanity, between us and the shadows stand the Knights of the Borrowed Dark. Unfortunately for Denizen, he's one of them. This book has landed on my desk today. I’ve read a chapter and I’m hooked. It’s seriously good.</p>

<p class="mt0">This second title in Steve Cole’s take on the <cite>Young Bond</cite> series is prefaced by that famous quotation, "The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing" (Edmund Burke). But we’ve no need to worry on that front, because Steve Cole like Charlie Higson before him, would never allow our hero “to do nothing” and he’s courageous from the start. James’ holiday in Cuba has become a nightmare mission to save an old friend from a ruthless killer as he rushes through Havana pursued by corrupt cops and hired assassins.</p>

<p class="mt0">Even though she knows it's impossible, Seren longs to have the sunshine on her skin. It's something she feels she needs to stay sane. But when you're hurtling through space at thousands of kilometres an hour, sometimes you have to accept there are things you cannot change. Except that the arrival of Dom in her life changes everything in ways she can barely comprehend. He becomes the sun for her, and she can't help but stay in his orbit. To lose him would be like losing herself.</p>

<p class="mt0">A picture book that takes abstract concepts, really big ideas, and illustrates them with understandable imagery. For instance, “if all the water on earth was represented by 100 glasses… 97 glasses would be filled with salt water" etc. It’s clever stuff and absolutely fascinating.</p>
