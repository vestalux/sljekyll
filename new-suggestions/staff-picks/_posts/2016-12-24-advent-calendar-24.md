Every day until Christmas Eve, a member of Suffolk Libraries staff will reveal a book, CD or DVD they will be giving as a Christmas present, and why. On our final day, Chief Executive Officer Alison Wheeler recommends <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2066588"><cite>The Ladybird Book of the Meeting</cite></a>, by Jason Hazeley &amp; Joel Morris.

I'm giving lots of these to people for Christmas:

> "This delightful book is the latest in the series of Ladybird books which have been specially planned to help grown-ups with the world about them.

> "The large clear script, the careful choice of words, the frequent repetition and the thoughtful matching of text with pictures all enable grown-ups to think they have taught themselves to cope. Featuring original Ladybird artwork alongside brilliantly funny, brand new text."
