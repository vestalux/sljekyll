Every day until Christmas Eve, a member of Suffolk Libraries staff will reveal a book, CD or DVD they will be giving as a Christmas present, and why. Today, Southwold Library manager Charlotte Clark recommends <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=209150"><cite>The Tailor of Gloucester</cite></a>, by Beatrix Potter.

I used to have this read to me every Christmas Eve when I was a child.  The beautiful illustrations of Simpkin, the tailor’s cat, and the mice he pursues are set against the tale of a poor, hungry, ill and cold tailor desperately trying to sew a coat and waistcoat for the Mayor of Gloucester’s wedding on Christmas Day.  It is a lovely story of what goes around comes around and shows you shouldn’t underestimate mice, or trust a cat to carry out a simple task!
