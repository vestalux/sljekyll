Every day until Christmas Eve, a member of Suffolk Libraries staff will reveal a book, CD or DVD they will be giving as a Christmas present, and why. Today, library and information advisor Debra Rowe recommends <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2025752"><cite>I'll Be Home For Christmas</cite></a>, by various authors.

You can’t fail to think of Christmas when you see this book, with its red-tipped pages and snowy cover. But while the new short stories and poetry in this collection are on the theme of home, they don’t all conjure up a cosy picture of comfort and joy. This is gritty and thought-provoking stuff and showcases some terrific writing aimed at young adults.

I love <cite>Bluebird</cite> by Julie Mayhew. It is beautifully written and I was hooked from the opening lines: <em>"Let’s start at the start. It’s winter. Moony night in a small town. Trainer-scuff black..."</em>

Another great read is <cite>Routes and Wings</cite> by Lisa Williamson, about a young girl snatching scraps of work thrown her way in a sandwich shop, forced to be secretive about her life away from her workplace, so that no-one knows she’s homeless and spends her nights bussing round London. It’s insightful and very moving - and carries a message of hope, much like the only poem in the collection, <cite>Home and Away<cite> by Benjamin Zephaniah.

I’m certainly going to buy this for an adult who appreciates good writing for young people, not least because £1 from every sale goes to Crisis, the homelessness charity.
