Every day until Christmas Eve, a member of Suffolk Libraries staff will reveal a book, CD or DVD they will be giving as a Christmas present, and why. Today, Elmswell Library manager Emma Yarrow recommends <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=734655"><cite>Elf</cite></a>.

<cite>Elf</cite>, the 2003 movie starring Will Ferrell, is the ultimate feel-good movie. Essentially it's the tale of a young man reuniting with his long lost father, but it's also about believing in magic and yourself.  The added treat is that it's absolutely hilarious and suitable for any age.

Buddy, an baby who sneaks into Santa's sack, grows up believing he is an elf, despite being three times the size of his family and friends. When the truth is revealed, Buddy, played with sheer joy by Will Ferrell, visits his father, who happens to be James Caan, positively relishing in being on Santa's naughty list. During their adventures, which involve Buddy falling in love, being accepted by his new family, and ultimately result in all of New York joining in believing in Santa once more, there is such charm and hilarity you can't help but be swept away on a wave of Yuletide joy!

Borrow it from your local library, buy some popcorn, snuggle under a blanket with your family and enjoy the festive frolics.
