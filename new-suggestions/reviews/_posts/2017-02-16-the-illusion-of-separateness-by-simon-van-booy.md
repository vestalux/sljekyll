**[See <cite>The Illusion of Separateness</cite> in our catalogue](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1514223).**

> "<cite>The Illusion of Separateness</cite> centres around one simple act of courage on the battlefield in the heart of France during World War Two, the implications of which reverberate through the future generations of two very different men."

This is a very unconventional book and beautifully written. It is not a long book. However, for the connections in the plot to be revealed, it requires close and slow reading. The links and connections are clever and subtle, crossing generations and crossing continents with the characters and story inspired by real people and true events, making it even more remarkable.

This is not a book to dip in and out of, or to whizz through or skim.

The gentle, graceful and unforced language is poetic, succinct and concisely written, full of rich metaphors and deep philosophical thoughts.

Recommendation: Not light, bedtime or beach reading or a quick read but a very unusual and intense book which makes you think about the random, yet transforming, connections in life. Poignantly and beautifully written.
