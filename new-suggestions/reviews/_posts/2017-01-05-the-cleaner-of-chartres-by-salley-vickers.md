**[See <cite>The Cleaner of Chartres</cite> in our catalogue](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1254237).**

> "A compelling story of darkness and light, of traumatic loss and second chances, <cite>The Cleaner of Chartres</cite> tells of the mysterious and elusive Agnes Morel whose little acts of kindness around a rural French cathedral touch the lives of others with consequences both good and ill. But when her tragic past is exposed, Agnes must face up to the truth of her origins."

This book is a delightful read, gentle but with unexpected twists. The story is very well written, with an interesting and believable range of characters. There is a build up of character development throughout the book due to the impact of the central female character, with the role of male characters being especially intriguing. An particularly compelling element of this story is the clever way in which the writer causes the main character to affect the lives of others, even from the start of her own.

The book is essentially a love story, with forgiveness and redemption overcoming past tragedies.

Recommendation: A good story, quick to read but containing deep truths, it makes an enjoyable and very readable book group choice.
