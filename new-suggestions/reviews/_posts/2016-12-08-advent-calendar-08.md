Every day until Christmas Eve, a member of Suffolk Libraries staff will reveal a book, CD or DVD they will be giving as a Christmas present, and why. Today, libraries innovation and development manager Krystal Vittles recommends <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=1958192"><cite>The Bubble Boy</cite></a>, by Stewart Foster.

<cite>The Bubble Boy</cite> by Stewart Foster has been my pick of 2016 for middle grade readers and parents and teachers and all adults and... you see where I’m going with this? Without giving too much away the book is narrated by Joe who lives his life in a ‘bubble’ in a hospital room because of an immune disorder – almost everything can and will kill him. His world is small and he has a few limited interactions with the outside world, that is, until Amir enters his life and changes everything.

It is utterly compelling and moving without slipping into mawkishness (John Green, I’m looking at you!). Fiona Noble, Children’s Editor for The Bookseller has called it "Poignant, hopeful and heartbreaking". The blurb says you should "expect superheroes, super nurses and a few tears from this truly unique story" and you won’t be disappointed in this regard. Treat yourself or a loved one to this remarkable book this Christmas.
