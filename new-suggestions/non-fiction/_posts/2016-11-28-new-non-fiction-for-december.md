Most of the popular non-fiction books are published in the run up to Christmas, so December is traditionally the time all the healthy lifestyle books appear in preparation for the after-Christmas rush to join gyms, kick the booze and shed any unwanted pounds. Here are a few of the best published in December.

Having spent the last few years in Denmark uncovering the secrets of the happiest country in the world, Helen Russell knows it's time to move back to the UK. She thinks. Maybe.

So she decides to give herself a year for an experiment: to overhaul every area of her life, learn how to embrace change, and become a lean, mean decision-making machine.

From how to cope with changing work lives and evolving relationships, to how we feel about our bodies, money and well-being, Helen investigates the benefits of new beginnings, the secrets of decisive people and what makes changes last - and uncovers the practical life lessons we can all use to thrive when change is afoot - and inject some freshness and magic if it's not.

<h2>Other new non-fiction</h2>

If the pursuit of chiseled abs is not for you here are a few other titles you may have missed.

<h3><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2084750">Raymond Clemens (ed.) - <cite>The Voynich Manuscript</cite></a></h3>

Many call the 15th-century codex, commonly known as the 'Voynich Manuscript', the world's most mysterious book. Written in an unknown script by an unknown author, the manuscript has no clearer purpose now than when it was rediscovered in 1912 by rare books dealer Wilfrid Voynich. It is often rumoured to have been owned by Elizabethan alchemist John Dee. This first facsimile allows readers to study the manuscript including its fantastical illustrations.

<h3><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?ENTRY=forever+words+the+unknown+poems&ENTRY_NAME=BS&ENTRY_TYPE=K&SEARCH_FORM=%2Fcgi-bin%2Fspydus.exe%2FMSGTRN%2FOPAC%2FBSEARCH%3FHOMEPRMS%3DBSEARCHPARAMS&SORTS=SQL_REL_TITLE&ISGLB=0&GQ=forever+words+the+unknown+poems">Johnny Cash and Paul Muldoon (ed.) - <cite>Forever Words: the unknown poems</cite></a></h3>

As a longtime fan of the Man in Black who saw him perform at the old Ipswich Gaumont in 1986 this is a bit of a treat. <cite>Forever Words</cite> contains never-beforeâ€“published poems and songs newly discovered from the Cash family archive. The poetry reveals his depth of understanding, both of the world around him and within - his frailties and his strengths alike. He pens verses in his hallmark voice, reflecting upon love, pain, freedom, fame and mortality. Illustrated with facsimile reproductions of Cash's own handwritten pages.

<h3><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?ENTRY=the+undoing+project&ENTRY_NAME=BS&ENTRY_TYPE=K&SEARCH_FORM=%2Fcgi-bin%2Fspydus.exe%2FMSGTRN%2FOPAC%2FBSEARCH%3FHOMEPRMS%3DBSEARCHPARAMS&SORTS=SQL_REL_TITLE&ISGLB=0&GQ=the+undoing+project">Michael Lewis - <cite>The Undoing Project: a friendship that changed the world</cite></a></h3>

From the bestselling author of <cite>The Big Short</cite> and <cite>Flash Boys</cite>, this is the surprising and profound story of two men whose ideas changed the world. Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky met in war-torn 1960s Israel. Both were gifted young psychology professors: Kahneman a rootless son of Holocaust survivors who saw the world as a problem to be solved; Tversky a voluble, instinctual blur of energy. Lewis tells the extraordinary story of a relationship that became a shared mind: one which created the field of behavioural economics, revolutionising everything from Big Data to medicine, from how we are governed to how we spend, from high finance to football.
