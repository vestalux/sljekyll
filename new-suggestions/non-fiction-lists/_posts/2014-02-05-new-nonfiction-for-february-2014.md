## [<cite>Under one roof: how a tough old woman in a little old house changed my life</cite> by Barry Martin & Philip Lerman](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/11505570?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(32815709)&QRYTEXT=Under%20one%20roof%20%3A%20how%20a%20tough%20old%20woman%20in%20a%20little%20old%20house%20changed%20my%20life)

The heart-warming true story of the bond between a feisty octogenarian and the man in charge of building a shopping mall on top of her home.

Edith Macefield achieved folk hero status in 2006 when she turned down $1 million to sell her home to make way for a commercial development in a small neighborhood of Seattle.

It didn&#8217;t matter that her tiny house was surrounded by rubble and graffiti. It was home. Barry Martin respected that, and when he took the job as construction supervisor for the shopping mall that was being erected around Edith&#8217;s little house, he determined to make things as easy as he could for her.

What does it take for one woman to drive 10,000km around India a land where bullock carts vie for space with SUVs on eight-lane super-highways, where GPS systems fail to give directions, and where a blessing from the gods is considered better road insurance than safer driving?

As Vanessa Able learnt, all it takes is a little bit of gumption, a whole lot of patience, and the world&#8217;s cheapest car the Tata Nano

Raising her from a fledgling, through adolescence and into her prime years, Windrow recorded every detail of their time living together – secretly – in a south London tower block, and later in a Sussex village.

This is the touching, intriguing and eccentric story of their 15 year relationship.
