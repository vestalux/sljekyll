      Companion book exploring the characters, the stories and the era that Winston Graham and the TV series set out to recreate. The England that Ross Poldark returned to from the American War of Independence and especially Cornwall was marked by social unrest and a deep division between rich and poor. It was a place of tin mines and shipwrecks, of new money versus old, of harsh justice and great kindness. And, above all, it was a place that inspired Winston Graham&#8217;s beloved novels. It also has lots of colour pictures of Aidan Turner for the less historically inclined.
