Week after week, the postcards arrive, addressed to a name Ellie does not know, with no return address, each signed with an initial: A. With their bright skies, blue seas and alluring images of Greece, these cartes postales brighten her life. After six months, to her disappointment, they cease. But the montage she has created on the wall of her flat has cast a spell. She must see this country for herself.

A classic story of murder and deceit, told by a narrator with a perspective and voice unlike any in recent literature.

Set in the Irish Midlands in the 1850s, <cite>The Wonder</cite> - inspired by numerous European and North American cases of 'fasting girls' between the 16th and the 20th centuries - is a psychological thriller about a child's murder threatening to happen in slow motion before our eyes. Pitting all the seductions of fundamentalism against sense and love, it is a searing examination of what nourishes us, body and soul.

Hilarious debut novel from comedian Andy Hamilton. Kevin Carver is a household name. A popular TV soap star, he's coasting through life in the same semi-detached, slightly smug way he's always done. But when he dumps his much-too-young-for-him girlfriend in the same callous way he's come to treat those around him, he makes the first in a series of mistakes. One poor decision leads to another and, as Kevin wades deeper into a moral grey area, things go from bad to very much worse.

From the foggy streets of Victorian London to the eerie perfection of 1950s suburbia, the everyday is invaded by the evil otherworldly in this unforgettable collection of new ghost stories from the author of <cite>The Woman in Black</cite>.

When a teenage joyrider crashes a stolen car and ends up in a coma, a routine DNA test reveals a connection to an unsolved murder from twenty-two years before. Finding the answer to the cold case should be straightforward. But it's as twisted as the DNA helix itself. Meanwhile, Karen Pirie finds herself irresistibly drawn to another mystery that she has no business investigating, a mystery that has its roots in a terrorist bombing two decades ago. And again, she finds that nothing is as it seems.
