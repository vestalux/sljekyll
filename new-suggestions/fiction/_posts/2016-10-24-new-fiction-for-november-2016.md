November is the month when many of the big hitters have a book out and we start with ‘Suffolk’s Favourite Author&trade;’. Year after year Lee Child tops the lists of the most borrowed books in Suffolk Libraries. <cite>Night School</cite> sees Jack Reacher go back to his army days.  We already have a sizeable list for this one but we are getting lots of copies!

Suffolk Libraries Bookfest guest Elly Griffiths returns with another case for DI Edgar Stephens and magician Max Mephisto.

A new novel from Zadie Smith is always a cause for excitement. <cite>Swing Time</cite> is a dazzlingly energetic and deeply human story about friendship, music and identity. Moving from north-west London to West Africa, it is funny and moving.

If you are looking for a blockbuster read you would probably be better reading one of the choices above but <cite>The Dark Flood Rises</cite> is a quiet gem. This is a book about growing old and dealing with your last years. It is told from several viewpoints, all of the people linked in some way to Francesca (Fran) Stubbs, an elderly woman who does work for a charity on aspects of living accommodation for the old. Margaret Drabble writes beautifully as ever, gradually revealing the lives of the main characters through her eye for detail and gentle humour.

When a newborn baby dies after a routine hospital procedure, there is no doubt about who will be held responsible: the nurse who had been banned from looking after him by his father. What the nurse, her lawyer and the father of the child cannot know is how this death will irrevocably change all of their lives, in ways both expected and not. Jodi Picoult discusses this book in her <a href="https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/meet-the-author/meet-the-author-jodi-picoult/">recent interview with Suffolk Libraries</a>.
