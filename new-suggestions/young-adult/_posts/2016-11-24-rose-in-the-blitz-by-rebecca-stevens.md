<cite>Rose in the Blitz</cite> is a touching story that weaves modern issues with important historical events. It is perfect for younger teens who are interested in history and enjoy reading the work of authors like Jacqueline Wilson. It is book two in the <cite>Rose</cite> series, the first of which was widely acclaimed for its immersive storytelling.

It’s the night before Rose’s mum re-marries. Rose can’t sleep for worrying and nor can her muddled Great-Aunt Cosy, her namesake. Rose sees the old lady leaving the house and runs after her to the London Underground. Their empty train stops in 1940, in a war-torn London broken by the Blitz. Here, Rose witnesses great romance and impending sacrifice. Tragedy will surely follow – unless she can change what happens next...

The clever mix of past and present also comes with a touch of very current issues with Great Aunt Cosy implied to have dementia, and this is dealt with in a very sensitive way. In a way it is also a story about letting go of the past and moving on to the future.

<cite>Rose in the Blitz</cite> is a very sweet story with a good moral message about love conquering all.
