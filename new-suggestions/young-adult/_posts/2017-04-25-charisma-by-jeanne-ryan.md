Would you take gene therapy if it made you more charming, funny and popular? This is what is offered to Aislyn if she takes underground drug 'Charisma'. Aislyn is painfully shy and it is starting to affect all aspects of her life.

Aislyn feels she has no choice but to take the drug even if it does come with side effects. She soon realises she's not the only one who has been offered it, and when other people start to experience unwanted symptoms, they realise that something may be very wrong.

What's worse is that the doctor who convinced them all to take it has disappeared. Aislyn decides with her new 'powers' to try and find out what is going on and hopefully find a cure. But does she want to lose her 'Charisma', and will she be too late?

This is the first book I have read by Jeanne Ryan and I really enjoyed it. I was intrigued by the subject of gene therapy and what happens when it goes wrong. Give this book a read.
