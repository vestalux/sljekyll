<cite>Life in A Fishbowl</cite> is one of those books that stays with you long after you’ve read the final page.

Fifteen-year-old Jackie Stone is a prisoner in her own house. Everything she says and does 24/7 is being taped and broadcast to every television in America. Why? Because her dad is dying of a brain tumour and he has auctioned his life on eBay to the highest bidder: a ruthless TV reality show executive at ATN.

Her sister's trust is gone, ever since she's been dazzled by the cameras and her new-found infamy. Her privacy is gone. The whole family's dignity is gone, as ATN twists their words and makes a public mockery of their lives on <cite>Life and Death</cite>. But most of all, Jackie fears that one day very soon her father will just be ... gone.

Armed only with her ingenuity and the power of the internet, Jackie is determined to end the show and reclaim all of their lives, even in death.

I loved this book. I’m going to be honest though, you will need some tissues while you’re reading it as there are a few highly emotional moments.

Vlahos deals with issues in such a sensitive, poignant and searingly honest way to create this intensely realistic book that you just can’t put down. It certainly doesn’t pull any punches, with harrowing opening pages and a twist that will leave you reeling.

There is a highly-entertaining cast of characters that range from an unhinged billionaire playboy to a fame-obsessed nun. Each character is developed over the course of the book and their stories intertwine, weaving an intricate tapestry of what fame really costs.

Above all of those, is a unique and thought-provoking perspective that changed the entire plot and for me, was what really made this book stand out. However, I can’t mention any details without giving away parts of the plot, so trust me when I say it’s just a brilliant idea.

<cite>Life in A Fishbowl</cite> is a bittersweet fusion of emotions that won’t let you go.
