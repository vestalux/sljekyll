Alex Turner and Miles Kane return with their follow up to 2008’s <cite>The Age Of The Understatement</cite>. This time round their songwriting was influenced by Isaac Hayes and The Style Council, as opposed to the Scott Walker influences of their first album.

Fran Healy and Travis have had two No.1 albums, five Top Ten singles, two Brit Awards and more than 8 million record sales in their career to date.
