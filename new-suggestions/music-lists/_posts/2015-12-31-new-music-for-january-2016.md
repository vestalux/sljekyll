Sia inhabits the role of a different characters in this album. After [<cite>1000 forms of fear</cite>](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/24298452?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(40610575)&QRYTEXT=1000%20forms%20of%20fear%20%5Bsound%20recording%5D), Sia has become a household name in America but she refuses to show her face in live performances to allow her to maintain some level of anonymity.

Britpop veterans Suede return with a new album that they recently played to great acclaim at the Roundhouse. In the gig, Suede projected a film directed by Roger Sargent and written by Stephanie de Giorgio, with each narrative element operating as an enclosed promo to a particular song. Dark but fascinating.

One of the best new bands of 2015. Lo-fi garage rock with hints of 60s girl-group pop and the Velvet Underground.
