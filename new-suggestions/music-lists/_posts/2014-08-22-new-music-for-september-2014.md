## [<cite>Live at the Rainbow ‘74</cite> by Queen](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/55931194?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN%2841337747%29&QRYTEXT=Live%20at%20the%20Rainbow%20%2774%20[sound%20recording])

Sunday 31 March 1974 is a landmark date in the history of rock music. This is a rare recording made at legendary London venue The Rainbow, of a concert by a then up–and–coming band called Queen. Few who turned up for that iconic performance could have predicted they would go on to become arguably the world’s best and most successful rock group, although many more may have suspected it after this stunning show.

Just before the March Rainbow gig, Queen performed their new single <cite>Seven Seas of Rhye</cite> on Top of the Pops. The highly coveted slot was a lucky break – they filled in for an absent David Bowie – and the band made the most of it, delivering a thrilling performance that pushed the song into the Top 10.

Although the group now had a first hit single under its belt, and second album Queen II had just been released to critical acclaim, many felt that playing <cite>The Rainbow</cite> was overambitious. It was the premier London venue of the time. The band’s confidence was vindicated when the venue quickly sold out the capacity of more than 3,000 seats – with some fans paying as much as £1.20 for a ticket! This is pre <cite>Bohemian Rhapsody</cite> but it is classic Queen.

## [<cite>Give my Love to London</cite> by Marianne Faithfull](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/55931945?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN%2841338979%29&QRYTEXT=Give%20my%20love%20to%20London%20[sound%20recording])

Marianne Faithfull’s new album is produced by Rob Ellis & Dimitri Tikovoi. Her band includes Portishead&#8217;s Adrian Utley (guitars), Ed Harcourt (keyboards), Rob Ellis (drums), Dimitri Tikovoi (bass) and a string quartet, and special guests Warren Ellis and Jim Sclavunos (Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds).

Marianne has written most of the lyrics, while the music was written by Nick Cave, Anna Calvi, Roger Waters, Pat Leonard, Tom McRae and Steve Earle. Marianne will shortly be embarking on a 50th anniversary tour.
