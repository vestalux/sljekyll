## [<cite>High hopes</cite> by Bruce Springsteen](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/6375815?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(51269)&QRYTEXT=High%20hopes)

Any new release by Springsteen is always worth investigating. <cite>High Hopes</cite> is unlike any other release in his catalogue in that half of the songs have been heard before, either on record or onstage. Three of those tracks are covers from acts that have not received much mainstream exposure, while the other nine are Springsteen originals.

## [<cite>Warpaint</cite> by Warpaint](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/5816785?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(9939196)&QRYTEXT=Warpaint%20%5Bsound%20recording%5D)

“Hugely anticipated” probably sums this one up following their debut album in 2010. Expect more mellow indie with off-kilter harmonies and ethereal guitar lines but with a few Nirvana type riffs thrown in.

## [<cite>Man on the rocks</cite> by Mike Oldfield](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/5817272?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(33162071)&QRYTEXT=Man%20on%20the%20rocks%20%5Bsound%20recording%5D)

Mike Oldfield had a good Olympics. His back catalogue started selling again and people remembered how good he is.

This is his first album of new material since 2008. Featuring 11 brand new tracks it is described as a deeply personal, song-based album that reflects many of Mike&#8217;s different influences.

Although Oldfield has worked with some of the world&#8217;s most famous vocalists in the past, here he has found an incredible young talent to interpret his words, Luke Spiller from the Struts.

## [<cite>Under the volcano</cite> by The Family Rain](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/6374614?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(9929365)&QRYTEXT=Under%20the%20volcano%20%5Bsound%20recording%5D)

<cite>Under the Volcano</cite> is the debut album from The Family Rain. Three brothers from Bath, they are a classic British rock band in the best tradition, a heady mix of hard rock and blues.

They&#8217;ve supported the likes of Biffy Clyro, The Rolling Stones, Miles Kane and Jake Bugg. Their debut album was recorded with Jim Abbiss (Arctic Monkeys) and includes the singles <em>Pushing It</em>, <em>Reason To Die</em>, <em>Feel Better (Frank)</em> and <em>Trust Me… (I’m A Genius)</em>. Definitely a band to watch in 2014.

## [<cite>Cursing the sea</cite> by September Girls (Freegal)](http://suffolklibraries.freegalmusic.com/artists/view/U2VwdGVtYmVyIEdpcmxz/888003905740/aW9kYQ==)

The debut album from Ireland&#8217;s September Girls is a dark kaleidoscope of echoey drums, buzzsaw bass, angular guitars and reverb-drenched vocals that blends garage rock and post-punk to extraordinary effect.

Drawing inspiration from the likes of Phil Spector, The Velvet Underground, The Cure, My Bloody Valentine and The Jesus And Mary Chain, the five-piece play reverb-soaked noise-pop of the finest order, with distant layered harmonies, swirling organ and distorted guitars once described as “sounds from a transistor radio abandoned in a rural cinema.”
