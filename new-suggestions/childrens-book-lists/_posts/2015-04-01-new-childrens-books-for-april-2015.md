      Highly recommended gem of a book encompassing environmental issues, peer pressure, family dynamics and politics with a goodly dash of theatre. In this novel, Hannah marshals her school friends to fight the water company planning to create a reservoir on the farm. Set to become a classic, it is a compelling read with credible characters.
