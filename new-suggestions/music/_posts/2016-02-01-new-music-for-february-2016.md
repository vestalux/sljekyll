## [<cite>Wonderful crazy night</cite> by Elton John](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/13844204?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(57962861)&QRYTEXT=Wonderful%20crazy%20night%20%5Bsound%20recording%5D)

Unbelievably this is Elton’s 33rd studio album. Judging by the first release from the album this is a return to his musical roots. It also has lyrics by Bernie Taupin so hopes are high for this one.

[![The ghosts of Highway 20 by Lucinda Williams](http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/the-ghost-of-highway-20.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/13847941?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(59883568)&QRYTEXT=The%20ghosts%20of%20Highway%2020%20%5Bsound%20recording%5D)

It is always a pleasure to welcome a new Lucinda Williams album. The songs on <cite>The ghosts of Highway 20</cite> are linked by a common theme. 12 of the 14 songs were inspired by various periods and experiences throughout Williams&#8217; life that all tie into Highway 20 (aka Interstate 20), which runs in part from Georgia to Texas.
