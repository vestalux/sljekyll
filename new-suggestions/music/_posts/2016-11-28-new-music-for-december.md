<h2>New albums for December</h2>

<h3><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?ENTRY_NAME=BS&ENTRY=rolling+stones+blue+%26+lonesome&ENTRY_TYPE=K&NRECS=10&SORTS=SQL_REL_TITLE&SEARCH_FORM=%2Fcgi-bin%2Fspydus.exe%2FMSGTRN%2FOPAC%2FBSEARCH%3FHOMEPRMS%3DBSEARCHPARAMS&GQ=rolling+stones+blue+%26+lonesome">The Rolling Stones - <cite>Blue & Lonesome</cite></a></h3>

A new album from the Stones is always an event. This one harks back to the early days of the band when they used to cover songs by classic bluesmen. This time round the songs include Howlin' Wolf (<cite>Commit a Crime</cite>), Little Walter (<cite>I Gotta Go</cite>) and Jimmy Reed (<cite>Little Rain</cite>). Eric Clapton guests on the group's cover of Little Johnny Taylor's <cite>Everybody Knows About My Good Thing</cite> and Otis Rush's <cite>I Can't Quit You Baby</cite>.

40 years after the huge international success of <cite>Oxygene</cite>, and 20 years from its second volume <cite>Oxygene 7-13</cite>, Jean-Michel Jarre is fulfilling a trilogy of albums with <cite>Oxygene 3</cite>, containing seven newly composed and recorded pieces, consistently titled parts 14-20. Jarre references some of the music from his entire body of work on <cite>Oxygene 3</cite>. It’s a state-of-the-art recording which embraces both classic and modern ways of music production.

Libertines frontman Peter Doherty follows up his last solo album, 2009’s <cite>Grace/Wastelands</cite>. Hamburg Demonstrations was recorded over six months in Hamburg. The first single, <cite>The Whole World is Our Playground</cite>, was released in April for Record Store Day. Before that, Doherty shared his tribute to Amy Winehouse, <cite>Flags of the Old Regime</cite> which appears here. The record also features “Hell To Pay At The Gates Of Heaven,” a song written in light of the Paris attacks, which Doherty debuted in June.

<h2>Albums from earlier in 2016 you may have missed:</h2>

<h3><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?ENTRY=joseph+I%27m+alone+you%27re+not&ENTRY_NAME=BS&ENTRY_TYPE=K&SEARCH_FORM=%2Fcgi-bin%2Fspydus.exe%2FMSGTRN%2FOPAC%2FBSEARCH%3FHOMEPRMS%3DBSEARCHPARAMS&SORTS=SQL_REL_TITLE&GQ=joseph+I%27m+alone+you%27re+not">Joseph - <cite>I'm Alone, No You're Not</cite></a></h3>

Joseph are three very talented sisters, Natalie, Allison and Meegan Closner from Portland, Oregon. If you like First Aid Kit or Ward Thomas you will probably like this one. They had a supporting slot for James Bay on his tour but they are poised to have their own success. <cite>I’m Alone, No You’re Not</cite> was released in August and debuted at no. 1 on Billboard's Heatseekers chart. They are touring the UK next year.

It is hard to believe that the duo leading this group are barely out of their teens. There is a bit of Led Zeppelin in there, some Cure, a bit of Velvet Underground and maybe some Marc Bolan. This one is well worth a listen.

<h3><a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?ENTRY=post+pop+depression&ENTRY_NAME=BS&ENTRY_TYPE=K&SEARCH_FORM=%2Fcgi-bin%2Fspydus.exe%2FMSGTRN%2FOPAC%2FBSEARCH%3FHOMEPRMS%3DBSEARCHPARAMS&SORTS=SQL_REL_TITLE&GQ=post+pop+depression">Iggy Pop - <cite>Post Pop Depression</cite></a></h3>

I’m not sure many people would have given odds on Iggy outliving his contemporaries David Bowie and Lou Reed. At an age when he could be sitting back and taking the credit for past glories, Iggy has released an album that is full of great songs. Songs like <cite>German Days</cite> and <cite>Gardenia</cite> can be traced back to his earlier work with Bowie.
