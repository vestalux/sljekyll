<h2>Fiona Melrose - <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?ENTRY_NAME=TI&ENTRY=midwinter&ENTRY1_OPER=%2B&ENTRY2_NAME=AU&ENTRY2=fiona+melrose&ENTRY2_TYPE=K&ENTRY3_NAME=SU&ENTRY3=&ENTRY_TYPE=K&ENTRY3_OPER=%2B&NRECS=20&SORTS=HBT.SOVR&SEARCH_FORM=%2Fcgi-bin%2Fspydus.exe%2FMSGTRN%2FOPAC%2FBSEARCH&CF=GEN&ISGLB=0&GQ=midwinter"><cite>Midwinter</cite></a></h2>

Father and son Landyn and Vale Midwinter, are men of the land, Suffolk farmers. Times are hard and they struggle to sustain their property, their livelihood and their heritage in the face of competition from big business. But an even bigger, more brutal fight is brewing: a fight between each other, about the horrible death of Cecelia, beloved wife and mother, in Zambia ten years earlier. A past they have both refused to confront until now.

Over the course of a particularly mauling Suffolk winter, Landyn and Vale grapple with their memories and their pain, raking over what remains of their fragile family unit, constantly at odds and under threat of falling apart forever. While Vale makes increasingly desperate decisions, Landyn retreats, finding solace in the land, his animals - and a fox who haunts the farm and seems to bring with her both comfort and protection.
