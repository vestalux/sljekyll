[![Wolsey: the life of King Henry VIII's cardinal by John Matusiak](http://suffolklibraries.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/wolsey-matusiak.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/9298889?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(40361998)&QRYTEXT=Wolsey%20%3A%20the%20life%20of%20King%20Henry%20VIII%27s%20cardinal)

A lighter read than most academic biographies of Wolsey. Matusiak has made a great effort to consider Wolsey&#8217;s internal self. He is presented not just as proud and cavalier, but also as a perfectionist, who would overload himself with work and became prone to bursts of anger when under pressure and stress-related illness. Matusiak demonstrates how more and more was expected of the King&#8217;s chief advisor, until he eventually cracked.
