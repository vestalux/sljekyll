excerpt: <cite>The Girl on the Train</cite> by Paula Hawkins.
---
Paula Hawkins’ debut novel, <cite>The Girl on the Train</cite>, has been acclaimed as one of 2015’s most enthralling thrillers. The novel follows Rachel Watson’s struggle to overcome her marital breakdown and the devastating series of events that enveloped by her alcoholism. Rachel turns to alcohol to numb the pain caused by her husband’s infidelity, but the repercussions of this obsession regularly leave her blacking out and forgetting the trouble she has left in her wake.

To escape her mundane world, Rachel creates fantasy lives for the people she witnesses on her daily commute to London and plays out visions of what she hopes her future will bring. She knows every figure she passes on her journey to heart, naming a couple she observes from the train’s window, Jess and Jason. Struggling with the recent break-up of her marriage, the union between Jess and Jason perhaps symbolises Rachel’s amicable past with her husband, Tom, and her desire for this past to return. However, Tom is newly married with a young daughter and his wife, Anna, has no plans on letting her family fall apart.

It is then on one particular commute to London that Rachel sees something that will change her life completely. What her voyeuristic peering shows her sets the stage for the dark series of events Hawkins unleashes upon the reader. Past soon catches up with present and lives once distant become closer. Hawkins’ plot line is masterfully compelling and will keep you racing to reach the novel’s denouement – and it does not disappoint.

<cite>The Girl on the Train</cite> is a brilliant crime read because it presents convincing characters the reader can identify with. The suburban setting in which their lives play out and the troubles they encounter are all very recognisable, and as such are believable. Furthermore, constructing the novel in epistolary fashion means the reader is able to see how past events influence the present and how three very different women (Rachel, Anna and Megan) have their lives collide together.

The book’s plot line has clear parallels with Gillian Flynn’s <cite>Gone Girl</cite> and has also been compared to Hitchcock’s voyeuristic-drama, <cite>Rear Window</cite>. Indeed, Rachel becomes immersed in the lives of strangers by peering through a window and her psychological pain stems from a failed relationship.

Perhaps my only issue with the novel was Rachel’s amnesia. Having a character who ‘forgets’ helps tremendously when writing a crime story, but for exactly that reason I felt it also simplified and negated the novel’s subtlety. That aside, I found <cite>The Girl on the Train</cite> a compelling read with clever tricks and spins that kept me enveloped. Here’s hoping the film adaption will live up to Hawkins’ novel.
