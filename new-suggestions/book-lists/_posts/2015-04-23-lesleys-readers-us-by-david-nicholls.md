    <cite>Us</cite> is the 2014 Man Booker longlisted novel by author David Nicholls. It&#8217;s a tragi-comedy that tells the poignant story of a couple&#8217;s last ditch attempt to reconcile their relationship by taking one incredible trip around Europe.

She’s the artistic, free-willed bohemian and he’s the regimented man of reason. While they are complete opposites, their marriage has remained content. However, irreconcilable differences are starting to emerge that threaten to end their time together. This is what prompts them to plan a ‘Grand Tour’ of Europe with their seventeen year old son. A trip through France, Amsterdam, Italy and Spain that has the aim of reconciling and reigniting their relationship. It’s hailed to be an unforgettable trip for the family – which it is, in more ways than one.

Already a seasoned novelist, with <cite>One Day</cite> and <cite>Starter for 10</cite> to his name, Nicholls is known for his skill in depicting human experiences with realism and gravitas. Having read and enjoyed both of these novels I had high expectations for his latest. Thankfully, <cite>Us</cite> doesn&#8217;t disappoint, offering me a coming of age story that interspersed comedy with sensitivity brilliantly.

The narrator is Douglas Peterson, a 54 year old professor in Biochemistry whose personality is dictated by his scientific mind that advocates rules and reason. Douglas has been happily married to Connie since their early twenties and loves her irrefutably. However, after losing their first daughter after birth and clashing over the upbringing of their only son, Albie, Connie’s desire to remain married to Douglas has wavered. This is what prompts Douglas to plan ‘The Grand Tour’, a route that will take the family through Europe, stopping at artistic landmarks in each city.

Nicholls’ choice of narrative takes us through the family’s journey brilliantly. Its constructed as a series of ‘books’ that signify each new destination and, in turn, developments in the family’s own personal journey. And so it turns out that Nicholls is quite the Euro-traveller – his depiction of Paris’ rustic rues and Amsterdam’s salacious districts are packed with informative references to real sites. It’s this emphasis on real life that makes <cite>Us</cite> so enjoyable to read. We identify not only with the places the family visit, but also the very real difficulties they face.

It’s in Amsterdam that new troubles emerge and, without giving the plot away, it is here that the novel takes on a new direction – both in plot and geography. The events that begin to unravel are thrilling and unpredictable – the book kept enticing me back. I always enjoy an unexpected ending!

I also enjoyed the narrative of <cite>Us</cite>. In typical Nicholls’ style it oscillates between past and present, and by doing so helps us develop a deeper understanding of the family. We are confronted with their sombre experiences and Connie’s secrets, adding a sense of tragedy to this otherwise heart-warming novel.

<cite>Us</cite> would appeal to anybody who likes travel-fiction, romance or tragi-comedies. It’s a beautifully written novel that&#8217;s easy to read, which has a plot packed with suspense, romance and melancholy. Now for the inevitable film adaptation!

## Lesley&#8217;s review:

It didn&#8217;t take me long to get hooked by the story.  I think anyone who has been in a relationship and has children will find lots to empathise with.  It’s also tinged with sadness because the central character, Douglas can’t communicate with his son Albie, nicknamed Egg.  He loves him enormously but just can’t find a way to understand him and having had 2 sons myself who are now grown up I could really relate to that!!

Douglas tells the story, which weaves the past and the present, of how he met his wife Connie and of how the three of them are now on a family tour of Europe which he hopes will save their marriage.

I was desperate for a happy ending&#8230;. But you&#8217;ll have to read it for yourself to find out if there is one!!
