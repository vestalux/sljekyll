![Too good to be true by Ann Cleeves, The anniversary by Various authors and The double clue and other Hercule Poirot stories by Agatha Christie](/images/featured/featured-quick-reads-2016.jpg)


<a href="http://www.quickreads.org.uk/">Quick Reads</a>, the publisher of short accessible titles written by popular authors, celebrates its 10th anniversary this year. Quick Reads aims to break down barriers to reading, since 1 in 6 adults in the UK struggle with reading, and 1 in 3 do not read for pleasure. Suffolk Libraries has supported Quick Reads for many years and will stock all the titles in 2016 as we have in previous years. There is an excellent selection of titles this year — why not give one a go?

      When young teacher Anna Blackwell is found dead in her home, the police think her death was suicide or a tragic accident. After all, Stonebridge is a quiet country village in the Scottish Borders, where murders just don&#8217;t happen. But Detective Inspector Jimmy Perez soon arrives from far-away Shetland when his ex-wife, Sarah, asks him to look into the case. The local gossips are saying that her new husband, Tom, was having an affair with Anna. Could Tom have been involved with her death? Sarah refuses to believe it &#8211; but needs proof. Anna had been a teacher. She must have loved kids. Would she kill herself knowing there was nobody to look after her daughter? She had seemed happier than ever before she died. And to Perez, this suggests not suicide, but murder.

      This is the call he is always ready for. They&#8217;ve had word of a planned attack. That&#8217;s why he&#8217;s back here, opposite some suit who&#8217;s trying to tell him what he needs to do. But he knows exactly what&#8217;s required. Four men. Plain clothes. Eyes peeled. Three targets. Two cases. One car. Gibraltar isn&#8217;t an ideal location. Too many people. Too many blind alleys. But then again, he&#8217;s not the terrorist. Who knows what goes through their minds? Well, he will soon. If everything goes to plan.
