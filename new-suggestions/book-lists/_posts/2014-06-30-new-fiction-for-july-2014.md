DCI Banks returns in the hugely popular crime series.

When two boys vanish under mysterious circumstances, the local community is filled with unease. And when a caravan belonging to one of the youths is burned to the ground, and a bloodstain is discovered in a disused World War Two hangar nearby, things quickly become much more sinister.

Assigned to the case, DCI Banks and his team are baffled by the mystery laid out before them. But when a motor accident throws up a gruesome discovery, the investigation spins into a higher gear – and in another direction.

Carlotta O&#8217;Keefe is happily engaged, and the wedding plans are coming together. She&#8217;s clear about her future path, both personally and in her busy career. Maybe Chris doesn&#8217;t make her heart race every time she sees him, but you can&#8217;t have that feeling for ever. Can you?

Then, on a trip to Seville, Carlotta runs into Luke Evans. Luke broke her heart so long ago she&#8217;d almost convinced herself she&#8217;d forgotten him. Now, he&#8217;s not that boy any more, but an attractive and intriguing man. And he can explain everything that happened way back when. Suddenly Carlotta&#8217;s not so sure of anything any more. The perfect summer distraction…
