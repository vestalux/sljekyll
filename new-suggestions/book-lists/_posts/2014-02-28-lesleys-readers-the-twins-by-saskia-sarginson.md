![The twins by Saskia Sarginson](/images/featured/featured-the-twins.jpg)

<cite>The twins</cite> is a really gripping read that keeps you guessing until nearly the end about what happens in the twins&#8217; childhood that affects the rest of their lives. The characters of Isolte and Viola are extremely well drawn and I really felt as though I knew them, in childhood in the 1970s and in adulthood in the 1980s.

It is not always an easy read as the themes are sometimes quite dark but it keeps you hooked. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up when I was reading about &#8216;the incident&#8217; in their childhood.

The other characters of the mother and the identical twin boys are thrown in warts and all. The only character I didn&#8217;t really get a feel for was Isolte&#8217;s boyfriend, Ben. Then again, it didn&#8217;t detract from my enjoyment of the book. The descriptions of Suffolk are fantastic and it is obvious that Saskia knows the county well. I also liked the moments in time she used, partly because I am a child of the 1970s myself. You really get a feel for how much more freedom children did have in that era compared to now. Saskia also throws in lots of historic pointers such as Ben&#8217;s friend being diagnosed with AIDS in the 1980s.

The ending is abrupt and I had to reread the last 2 pages to get a handle on it. However, it works and I would definitely recommend this book as one to read.

## Gill Charlton&#8217;s review:

An enjoyable book, with good twists both in the Polly story and in the death of Michael. Being a twin myself, I can say that Saskia has got a good grip on the twin relationship — like Issy and Viola, we were always being asked if we could tell what the other twin was thinking or doing, and her description of the twins meeting Michael and John for the first time took me back to my school days when we met another pair of twins for the first time – quite a shock to the system when you are used to being unique! I would have liked the book to have finished with Viola meeting John again, but perhaps that is best left to the imagination! Overall, I enjoyed reading the book, and the story kept me captivated right to the end.
