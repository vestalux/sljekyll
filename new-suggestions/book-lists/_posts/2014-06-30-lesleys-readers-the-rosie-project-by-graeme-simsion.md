![The Rosie project by Graeme Simsion](/images/featured/featured-the-rosie-project.jpg)

This is an ideal summer read. I loved the humour in it. The underlying plot is that a lecturer in genetics, Don Tillman, hits 40 and decides that the logical thing to do is to find a wife, as married men live longer. Whereas most people would look for love, Don looks for as many ticks as possible on his ‘wife’ questionnaire. The story is told through Don’s matter-of-fact Asperger&#8217;s point of view, which makes for a refreshingly different and insightful read.

Don’s wife project gets put on the back burner when Rosie enters his life and the new project becomes to find out who Rosie’s father is by collecting DNA from all the possible suspects from her mother’s college class! The ways they come up with for doing this gives us the most belly laughs and place Don well and truly outside his comfort zone.

If you know anyone with Asperger&#8217;s, this book will mean even more to you. The author handles it with care and never makes fun of Asperger&#8217;s only the way those without it just don’t get it and that those with it&#8230; well it all just makes sense. After all, when someone asks you a question, why wouldn’t you respond with the truth? Don does start to realise what effect his responses have on people’s emotions which makes for an entertaining inner dialogue. I am not sure how realistic this would be but that aside the whole thing makes for a quirky, fun, boy meets girl, will-they-won’t-they read.

I loved the book.

## Lesley Dolphin&#8217;s review:

I knew within minutes of starting this book that I was going to enjoy it. Don is a geneticist and the central character telling the story. Although it is never stated, I assume that he is on the autistic or Asperger’s spectrum and hence sees the world from a slightly different perspective. Don says that &#8220;I have never found it easy to make friends, and it seems that the deficiencies that caused this problem have also affected my attempts at romantic relationships.&#8221;

His solution is to run a scientific project getting potential partners to fill in a very detailed questionnaire asking things like: Do you eat kidneys?! Needless to say, when he meets Rosie we soon learn that she doesn’t give the right answers to most of the questions but he finds he still wants to help her with her own project — to find out who her biological father was. So does Don end up finding a suitable partner? Well I&#8217;m not going to tell you — you’ll have to get the book.

It’s a really easy read and I loved the underlying humour and although I&#8217;m not sure whether the author has any first-hand experience of autism, this feels really accurate and seems to give a great insight.

## Sam Pease&#8217;s review:

A great read, I read it in one day. Thank you for recommending it! I really enjoyed reading it and the observations on relationships.
