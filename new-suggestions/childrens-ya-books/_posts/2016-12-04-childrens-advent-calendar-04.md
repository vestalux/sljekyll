Every day until Christmas Eve, stock team member and book expert Jo Dixon will recommend a great title for children. Today's book is <a href="https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ?BRN=2003017"><cite>I'll Wait, Mr Panda</cite></a>, by Steve Antony.

Mr Panda is making a big surprise. What is it? The animals must wait and see. But waiting is boring. Only one little penguin has the patience and politeness to stick around. Will he be rewarded?
