      Bear and Duck are neighbours with radically different biological clocks. Poor old Bear, looking drugged with tiredness and trying to sleep, is harassed by wide-awake Duck who wants to make cookies in the middle of the night. The illustrations are perfect, and the story is very funny.

      Superb picture book about doughnuts. It’s a perfect joy to look at and to read aloud, and how excellent to have another gem of a picture book to deal, without preaching, with the perennial question, “What do you say?”

### [<cite>I am Henry Finch</cite> by Alexis Deacon & Viviane Schwartz](http://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/4857673?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(44256784)&QRYTEXT=I%20am%20Henry%20Finch)

    <p>
      Using red thumb prints and black pen marks, Viviane Schwartz creates simple images to translate this thought-provoking tale into something that children can understand. It’s a story about a little bird who thinks for himself, demonstrates personal courage and changes attitudes; a good starting point for philosophical discussions and is nice to look at too.

      It’s by Jeremy Strong, so you’d expect it to be funny. However, you might not expect the narrator to be a raven, or to learn lots of Latin words and details of Roman life as well too. What a triumph, hilarious and good for you!

      Amsterdam, 1945 &#8211; 15 year old Tygo is working as a locksmith for a German officer, helping him to loot empty houses, and hoping to rescue his sister from the Nazis. He lives in fear of his life from both the Germans and the Dutch Resistance. It’s a gripping page turner, as was Osborne&#8217;s previous novel <cite>Hitler’s angels</cite>. Brilliant.
