Laura’s house has a new baby and it’s very quiet there, so she practices being a kangaroo, an elephant and a parrot. But when her vivid imagination conjures up a lion, well that practising is not so welcome. A sweet story, tenderly resolved and perfect for bedtime reading.

### [<cite>Yikes, Ticklysaurus!</cite> by Pamela Butchart](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/24662717?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(51020051)&QRYTEXT=Yikes%2C%20Ticklysaurus!)

This rhyming story romps along with the type of humour so loved by pre-school audiences. But will T-Rex be amused? Oh the suspense!

[![When I first met you, Blue Kangaroo! by Emma Chichester Clark](/images/article/when-i-first-met-you-blue-kangaroo.jpg)](https://suffolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/OPAC/BIBENQ/24670354?QRY=CTIBIB%3C%20IRN(51848477)&QRYTEXT=When%20I%20first%20met%20you%2C%20Blue%20Kangaroo!)

Katie doesn’t want just any ordinary old pet, oh no. She wants a zebra. Now this theme may have been covered before, but it’s always good for a laugh, particularly if you no longer have small children! If when you’ve finished it, the subject of pets still won’t go away, why not try the well-loved Inkpen classic <cite>The Great pet sale</cite>?

## Short chapter books

Creating a book that’s short enough to be read by a child who is new to reading alone, and funny enough to make that same child want to read more of the same, is an enviable skill. Stephane Daniel and Christophe Besse have mastered the trick, for <cite>Sir Scatterbrain the Hopeless Knight</cite>, published a few weeks ago, is packed with appeal for new readers. This new title and it’s sister book <cite>Mistress Scatterbrain</cite> look set to do the same.

<cite>Winnie the Witch</cite> books only used to be available in picture book format, but as short chapter books for new readers, they’re just alive with &#8216;pick me up, read me and laugh&#8217; appeal.
