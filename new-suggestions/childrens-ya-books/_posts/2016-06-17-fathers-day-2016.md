<p class="mt0">We were very pleased to see this classic Spot story back in print again, so we’ve bought lots of copies. It’s a great short read for bedtime, kind reassuring and comfortable.</p>

<p class="mt0">Just out in board book format in time for Father’s day, is Nick Butterworth’s very fond celebration of fatherhood. It’s warm, funny and has a lovely clear font for children who are beginning to read for themselves.</p>

<p class="mt0">Bold cheery colours and bright cheesy rhymes about a panda who “is big and kind and hairy. He smells of safe and warm”, make this picture book perfect fare for Father’s Day. And because this particular family of pandas don’t restrict their diet to bamboo, they and their lovely book should last a good long time. Mmmm pancakes…</p>

<p class="mt0">A fun-filled day is in store for dads when the tables are turned by their young children. “Don’t ignore when we’re talking, and stop looking at your phone. Don’t watch the news come out and play – it’ no fun on our own.”</p>

<p class="mt0">Here is a picture book with a rollicking rhyme. It’s fun to read aloud, has great “boy” appeal so girls would love it too.</p>

<p class="mt0">Just in time for father’s day comes this story about a young father looking back wistfully to his youth spent playing in a band, motorcycling, and getting tattoos. His young son still thinks he's the tops and we think this picture book is all set to become the present to buy for all new dads. Keith Negley’s <cite>Tough guys have feelings too</cite> was published last year, and uses the same playful style of illustration to disguise the softer side of being a boy and a man.</p>

<p class="mt0">When Dad Bear says, "I think a pair of hot bears is probably the hottest thing in the world," Little Bear suggests that they go all the way to the river to cool down. But what will happen when Little Bear tries to impress his dad by doing a big jump across the rocks?</p>
