Witty adaptation of Jane Austen's novella from film-maker Whit Stillman. Kate Beckinsale stars as Lady Susan, a high-class widow whose waning finances threaten her status and lifestyle.

Accompanied by her American confidante Mrs. Alicia Johnson (Chloë Sevigny), who is waiting for her elderly husband (Stephen Fry) to pass on, the sharp-tongued Lady Susan sets her sights on charming Reginald de Courcy (Xavier Samuel) in the hope of a marriage and financial security. Her plans are disrupted with the arrival of her daughter Frederica (Morfydd Clark), upon whom Lady Susan thrusts the dull, but extremely wealthy, Sir James Martin (Tom Bennett).

Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe team up to investigate the case of a missing girl in this thriller co-written and directed by Shane Black.

After becoming involved with the Mob, Amelia (Margaret Qualley) mysteriously disappears.

With media interest increasing and their own personal safety called into doubt, the duo come across the seemingly unconnected death of a porn star, a discovery which sheds new light on a conspiracy that leads right to the highest echelons of power. The cast also includes Kim Basinger, Angourie Rice and Matt Bomer.
